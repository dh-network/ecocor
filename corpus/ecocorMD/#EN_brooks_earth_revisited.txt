And tuneful Horace wrote — 

" Death comes alike to all — to the monarch'ft lordly 

hall, 
And the hovel of the bofi^g'ar, and his Hunimons none 

can Htay. 
01 Sostius, happy Sestius, use the moments as they 

pass, 
Far-reaching hopes are not for us — the creatures of 

a day." 

But the fact that death is the common lot of 
men was no consolation to mo. I recalled the 
old syllofjism of the schools : " All men are 
morbd ; Socrates is a man ; therefore Socrates 
is mortal." I was willing to admit its appli- 
cation to Socrates and all other men, but I 
would not consider that it embraced me in its 
vast conclusion. 

I was not yet fifty years of age. I had laid 
plans and undertaken enterprises which would 
require a century for their completion. I had 
recently made a large investipent in Western 
lands, awaiting the growth and development 
of the country for my returns and had still 
greater plans in mind. 

I was not ready to die. I had always 
thought of death, when I thought of it at all, 
as something to be prepared for in the distant 
future. Other men were dying daily about me, 
but that did not impress me greatly. My 
neighbor^ a young man much stronger than I,

had taken a slight cold, neglected it, contracted 
pneumonia, ana in a week was dead. My friend, 
an active young man with Iuh life before him, 
left his house one morning for a business 
journey, stepped in front of a passing train 
and was brought home a corpse witliin an hour. 
A business acquaintance, learning that Blight's 
disease was fastened upon liim, had abandoned 
himself to every kind of excess, contracted 
debts everywliere possible, expended the money 
in luxurious living and gone out of the world 
leaving a trail of disgrace behind him. I 
would make no such dishonorable departure. 
But I had not considered tlie possibility of 
death as a factor in my life. Now, as the 
Idumean patriarcli mourned, " the evil that I 
dreaded most had come upon me." It had not 
come as a thief in the night ; but like a besieg- 
ing army it had set down before me and de- 
manded my luiconditional surrender. 

I could only sit and look my grim enemy in 
the face and await tlie end. But what was to 
be the end ? With tlie patient noet, I could 
but ask, " If a man die shall he live again ? " 
and find no answer. Of one thing only was I 
sure : I was about to die, and I was not pre- 
pared. I did not greatly fear what might be 
in store for me beyond tlui grave, but I could 
not endure the thought of being thus rudely 
wrenched out of life with all my plans and

purposes so fruitless and incomplete. True, 
they were solely selfish purposes, but they were 
all that had oetnuued my active existence. 

I had always been very methodical in my 
business, and a littte time sufficed to set my 
house in order. I had readily arranged my 
affairs so that they could be conducted without 
me. In fact, I was deeply surprised to find 
how easily 1 could be dispensed with. I had 
made my will and left everything to my wife 
and children. Yes, I was about to leave every' 
thhiy ! 

I had been accounted a man of wealth, but 
now I was worth nothing. My property re- 
mained, but it was not nnne. I had brought 
nothing into the world and it was certain I 
could carry nothing out. The beggar in the 
street was richer than I. I had a large insur- 
ance on my life, a tontine policy in the Provi- 
dence Mutual Life Assurance Society. But* 
it was not for my benefit. . It could not assure 
me a day's lease of life. My buildings were 
insured against fire, but they might never 
burn. My death was assured. The company 
took a risk only on the length of my life. 
What would I not have given to obbiin a few 
days' extension of that ! My " expectation of 
life," I had been informed, was over thirty 
years ; but I had not lived one-third of it. I 
was bankrupt.

I had every (comfort that money eouhl pro-

believed that the fabled Hpring of youth were yet 
to be found Honx^where on the globe. I went 
reHtlennly from jdacui to pla(j(», (»ag(!rly following 
every pHmiine of betterment, finding no inUir- 
ent in anything, carrying everywhere with me 
my dying body and dinorden^d mind. 1 then

out to burial." The grotesque gargoyles above 
the door grinned as I passed, and I thought, 
" They will grin as calmly when I go down. 
Those who follow me will not smile — until I 
am laid out of sight. Then the wonted ex- 
pression will return. All will go on as be- 
fore." I imagined I had filled an important 
place in life ; but I could now see how small 
it was. The very shadow of my coming dis- 
solution was sufficient to obliterate all the figure 
I had made in the world. My wife — ^good 
woman — was assiduous in her attentions. No 
expense was spared. Still I imagined that she 
felt that it was her money she was expending 
and that she took credit to herself in so doing. 
She was tearful and sad, as was natural ; still I 
thought, " It is for herself that she is weeping, 
not for me. She is not dying. She is already 
thinking that mourning garb will be becoming 
to her and that she will enjoy a degree of 
freedom for which she has often sighed." 

We had been married twenty-five years. 
She was not my first love ; nor I hers. We 
were not affinities ; but there had been a 
personal attraction in our youth which took 
the place of love. We had been faithful to 
each other — in deed. We bore the yoke 
decently. My wife's ambition was to be a 
society leader. I despised fashionable society. 
I was so busy making money that I could see 



EARTH REVISITED. 'H 

no profit or pleasure in it. I furnished her 
the money she desired and she managed my 
household affairs. Thus we had Uved in the 
same house, walked, sat, and slept together for 
twenty-five years ; but in reality we were per- 
fect strangers. Her person was familiar to me, 
but of her heart and mind I knew nothing. I 
had long been aware that she did not under- 
stand me and did not care to. But it was 
mainly my fault. There had been a time in 
our early married life when her heart was open 
to me and I might have known and possessed it. 
But I did not perceive its value until too late. 
I neglected the jewel ; I turned away from the 
fragrance of the opening flower until, like the 
sensitive plant, it shut at my approach and in- 
closed its sweetness forever. I was so absorbed 
in my business that I had little time for getting 
acquainted witli my wife. She was mine and 
that was enough. I gave her as good a home 
as I could afford, desired her to dress and Uve 
as became my wife, and felt that I had done 
my duty to her. Thus she naturally sought 
occupation in society. She thought that I was 
hard and selfish ; but she did not understand 
me. 

I sought wealth not for its own sake mainly, 
but in order to make a position in life for 
myself and family. I knew no other way of 
obtaining it. I thought money could purchase

everything. We were both selfish, seeking our 
own happiness and not each other's — and thus 
losing both. I believed that she had an im- 
mortal soul ; but I treated her as if she were 
only a valuable animal. I now saw these 
things in a very different light. The shadow 
of death, while it obscured many of the moun- 
tains of life, brought into clear view many a 
vale of unexplored beauty and many an unsus- 
pected chasm of darkness over which I had 
trodden in brutal blindness. But it was too 
late to retrace my steps. My Ufe was at an 
end, and it had brought little happiness or good 
to myself or others. I realized the truth of 
what a witty Frenchman had recently written 
of my countrymen : '' If it were given to man 
to live twice on this planet, I could understand 
his living his first term a VAmericane^ so as 
to be able to enjoy in his second existence the 
fruits of his toil in the first." 

My " first term " had been spent in fruitless 
toil. My only enjoyment had been in the 
society of my daughter. She was now a sweet 
rosebud of seventeen. I clung to her more 
than to anything else in the world. For her 
alone I had anxious thoughts of the future. 
She was now all innocence and sweetness. But 
soon the social sirocco would strike her, wither 
all her fair petals and dissipate her innocence 
forever. " Then," thought I, " she will marry 



EARTH REVISITED, 13 

— ^for love, or something else — and most prob- 
ably it will be for something else, under her 
mother's influence. Then my bonny child will 
be no more." 

I had scarcely known my boy. When an 
infant, he had been left to the charge of his 
mother and nurses, babies being of little account 
to me until they were able to talk and walk. 
Then he amused me — when I had time to be 
amused. I was in haste to have him grow up 
and be a man. He was sent to school, and I 
saw little of him until he was almost grown. I 
was proud of him as I saw his desire to follow 
in his father's footsteps. What kind of an 
education he had had I knew not : probably 
the worst that was to be had for the money. 
Little moral or religious training had I given 
him, though I had been a member of the Pres- 
byterian Church for twenty years. I did as 
others did, and brought up my children by 
proxy. Now my prattling boy was gone from 
me forever, and in his stead I found a young 
man whom I had brought into the world, but 
in the molding of whose character I had done 
little and for whom I could now do nothing. 
The money that I should leave him I knew 
might prove the worst inheritance I could be- 
queath him. But that was all I could give him. 

One morning, a few days before my departure, 
my daughter came into my room, and running

16 EARTH REVISITED. 

Life was merely a " probation " for a world 
to come. Its end was " a heaven to win, and 
a hell to shun." Believing that my " calling 
and election " were sure, I had felt a mild in- 
terest in the fate of my fellow-mortals ; not so 
much from love for them as from a forced 
sense of gratitude for my own salvation. I 
was a member of the most aristocratic church 
on the avenue. I attended regularly, con- 
tributed liberally, partook of communion, and 
felt that my eternal life was fully assured. 

But now as I sat in my room, face to face 
with death, a gigantic doubt assailed me. 
" What if my creed be not true ! It matters 
little what I believe ; what is the truth ? The 
Christian faith may be after all only a faith. 
What are the facts ? I want trutlis which may 
be apprehended by my reason and experience, 
which all men may grasp and live by. If the 
whole vast edifice of faith be but the ' baseless 
fabric of a vision,' let me know it now. As 
my hold on life relaxes, I feel for the pillars 
of truth to which I will cleave as the world 
goes down. Nothing but the hard granite of 
firm fact can sustain me now. I will cling 
to the cold cables of eternal verity which 
enwrap the world, as the billows of death go 
over me." 

But it was too late to examine the founda- 
tions of my faith or to acquire new truth. As 



EARTH REVISITED. 17 

I looked upon the past, of one fact I was as- 
sured. My life was a failure. If there were 
no future life, I had made shipwreck of my 
only existence. If there were a hereafter, 1 
had missed the only preparation for it. God 
might forgive my infraction of His law, but He 
coidd not undo the wrongs done to my fellow- 
men, nor restore my lost opportunities. I re- 
membered the words of the Master I professed 
to follow, " I was sick and in prison and ye 
visited Me not ; inasmuch as you did it not to 
the least of My brethren." My only certainty 
— life, which I might have made a heaven and 
which I had wasted while looking for a heaven 
hereafter — my life was ended. 

As I passed in review its early scenes, so 
long forgotten, their meaning, developed by the 
light of death into vivid portraits of moral 
character, now appeared in sfcirtling clearness. 
I saw myself, a boy in my humble country 
home, the idol of my fond mother and pious 
father, who spared no toil nor sacrifice to give 
their son the advantages denied to them. I 
took them all thankless from their hands, de- 
manded them as my right, complained of their 
insufficiency, and grew up in selfish ambition, 
determined to better my condition in life at 
whatever cost. For many years their forms 
had lain in the village churchyard, their hearts 
cold to the tokens of love and gratitude which 



18 EARTH REVISITED, 

would have made their hard lives happy. But 
they had lived and died with no signs of affec- 
tion.f rom the son for whom they had spent their 
mortal existence. I saw the country maiden 
whom I had wronged. She had given me her 
heart, herself, in the abandonment of youthful 
love and confidence, which I had taken self- 
ishly, as I had taken all that came to me, and 
as carelessly cast away. I, who prided myself 
upon being a man of honor, who would scorn 
to break his word to a fellow-man, thought it 
no wrong to deceive a trusting and loving 
maiden. Not only had I despoiled her of her 
innocence, but I had ruined her whole life. 
She had married a man whom she did not love, 
and after a few years had separated from him 
and gone into the world's wide ways, I knew 
not whither. I had done an irreparable injury 
to a fellow-creature. 

But one bright spot appeared in the darkness 
of my life-picture. I had once been in love ; 
truly, deeply in love — and not with myself ; 
though I could not claim that my affection had 
been entirely free from selfishness. Yet the 
end had been a sad one for us both. When I 
first met Theresa Stewart 1 was twenty-one years 
of age and she was eighteen. A purer, sweeter, 
nobler soul never lived. She loved me with 
her whole heart, and I was madly in love with 
her. I was intoxicated with love. The world 



EAR TH REVISITED. 1 9 

took on a new tinge. I trod on air. I envied 
those who were dwellers in the same townjf^itli 
her. I was happy only in her society. True, 
it was my own happiness, even then, that I 
pursued more than hers. But when in her 
company I was lifted out of my selfish ambi- 
tions to higher planes of thought and feeling 
than I had ever known. Her love, like all true 
affection, was perfectly unselfish. She had no 
thought but for others, and desired only to 
make them better and hap^er. She was the 
idol of her home, and all who knew her loved 
her. But it did not please me that she should 
have affection for any one but me. She was 
an angel to me — and I lost her. 

When I went to college we were separated. 
We kept up a warm correspondence through 
most of the term, though it began to cool to- 
ward the close. Still I loved her and intended 
to marry her. At the end of my college 
course I had an advantageous opportunity to 
go to a distant city and engage in a business 
which I was very desirous of entering. I 
wrote to Theresa that I thought it best for the 
present to release her from our engagement. 
She understood it all. When I visited her to 
bid her good-bye she spoke no word of reproach. 
She bade me an affectionate farewell and God- 
speed with a cheerful smile, while two crystal 
drops stood in her eyes and she clasped her 



20 EAIirn nEVTSITED, 

hands to her bosom as if to repress the rising 
sobs. Her heart was broken. 

I never saw her again in life. Her health 
failed, and within a year — one never-to-be-for- 
gotten day — came a telegraph dispatch sa3dng, 
" Theresa is dead." Then I realized what I 
had lost and sank into the deepest despair. 
The gates of heaven had stood open before me, 
and closed forever. My only opportunity for 
obtaining happiness in this life was gone. My 
own hand had dashed the cup from my lips. 
Yet in the depths of my despair and longing I 
could say, " I have at least known true joy ; I 
have loved and been beloved." 

At times, in after years, her image would 
appear to me in visions of the night — sad, but 
still loving and uncomplaining — though sorrow- 
ing for my lapse from the path of love and 
virtue. She became the guiding star of my 
life. I believed that she was yet alive in 
another world and that she still loved me and 
watched over me. I named my daughter after 
her, and sometimes fancied that I perceived a 
resemblance between them. 

Now, as I looked into the future, I felt that 
if there were a future for me, my long-lost 
love might be awaiting me, and that, reunited 
to her, I could cast off the coils of selfishness 
and be a true man at last. For I realized that 
my life had not been even that of a reasoning 



EARTH REVISITED. 21 

animal calling himself a man. In the selfish 
pursuit of happiness here and hereafter, I had 
missed the whole value and meaning of exist- 
ence. Now, for the first time, I perceived that 
only in service to others can happiness be 
found. 

But life was mine no more ! My one oppor- 
tunity was gone. " God," I cried, "if there 
be a God, give me another opportunity ! I 
am unfit for heaven. I do not want it so 
undeserved ; but in this world I could do some 
good ; I could help to lighten a fellow-mortal's 
burden and thus make life worth living and 
become fit for a higher state. give me life ! 
life ! " I sighed as I sank into exhaustion and 
unconsciousness. 

When I opened my eyes, my family and 
friends were about me. " He has revived," 
whispered my wife, as she offered me a stimu- 
lant. I tried to take it, but could not. I 
could not speak. I could not move a muscle ; 
but I could hear those about me. They were 
weeping, though I could see no occasion for it. 

" He is almost done with this world," said 
the physician. 

" No, no ! " I exclaimed, " I am not done 
with the world. I cannot leave it thus ! " 
But they did not seem to hear me. I felt a 
paroxysm of agony and reproach that my friends 
would not heed nor answer me. But at length. 



22 EARTH REVISITED, 

I perceived the truth. " This, then, is death. 
The inevitable hour is come. But why 
should I distress myself ? " Then I noticed 
Theresa standing near me. She wore the same 
youthful expression of love and peace that I 
had remembered all the years. She beckoned 
to me lovingly to come to her. I endeavored 
to rise, but I was unable to do so. I fell back 
upon my pillow in complete exhaustion. Then 
a feeling of deep peace and rest came over me. 
I closed my eyes. I had determined years be- 
fore that 1 would not die with my eyes open. 

" I am coming, Theresa," I whispered, as I 
ceased to breathe. 

" He is no more for earth," said the physi- 
cian as he dropped my pulseless hand. " He 
is dead." 

While the weeping group stood beside my 
bed, it seemed gradually to rise and lift me 
above them. An ethereal Ughtness possessed 
me. Upward I slowly floated while the room 
with its mourners grew dim and distant, and 
disappeared. I was alone in the vast vacuity 
of space, a naked, shivering soul. A deep 
darkness of horror engulfed me. I could 
endure no more. Memory forsook her throne ; 
kind oblivion came to my relief. I was dead. 



EARTH REVIISITED. 28 



n. 



" He is reviving. All is now ready/' I heard 
a strange voice say. Then all was still. Pres- 
ently the curtains of my couch were withdrawn 
by an unseen hand. I sat up and looked about 
me. The bed upon which I lay, the curtains, 
the chairs, and all the furnishings of the room 
were familiar. The light of a warm June after- 
noon streamed in, filling the place with subdued 
radiance and warmth. A f eeUng of deep peace 
and strength pervaded my mind and aU my 
members. I fell back upon the cushions and 
closed my eyes in dreamy satisfaction. Long 
I lay thus in blissful reverie, unmindful of the 
past, unquestioning of the present. At length 
a dim recollection of my death-bed scene stole 
over me, and I awoke to the fact that I was 
alive ; not only hving, but well and strong, and 
without a trace of age or illness about me. 
Why, then, was I in bed and alone ? What 
were the voices I had heard, and what did all 
this mean? Again I rose and surveyed my 
surroundings. All were familiar, but as I caught 
sight of my face in the mirror, I started back 
with astonishment and awe, for the features 
reflected there were not my own. I saw, as 1 
stood before it, the face and form of a young 



1&gt;4 EARTH REVISITED. 

man, about twenty-five years of age, tall and 
well-built, with a thoughtful cast of counte- 
nance, overspread by a paleness which spoke of 
long illness ; yet underneath all was a strange, 
indefinable resemblance to my former self. 
Overwhelmed by the discovery, I threw myself 
into a chair and endeavored to collect my 
thoughts; but, so swiftly and tumultuously 
they thronged upon me, I was utterly unable 
to find myself amid the whirl of strange recol- 
lections. 

While I thus sat pondering and asking where 
were my family and my friends, and why they 
had thus deserted me, I heard a soft footfall 
and a gentle sigh. Quickly lifting my head, I 
saw before me a maiden, fair and graceful as the 
lily, dressed all in white, with red roses in her 
hair and at her bosom, while in her hand she 
held a half -opened rosebud with the dew yet 
upon its petals, hiding amid its leaves of green. 
A look of deepest love and joy beamed in her 
large brown eyes, mingled with eager question- 
ing and tender solicitude as she gazed upon me. 
A moment thus she stood before me, with the 
same questioning look of love and joy that I 
recalled so well. 

" Theresa, my long-lost love ! " I murmured, 
and stretched out my arms to her. 

With a quick cry of joy and recognition, she 
threw herself upon my breast, while tears of 
gladness suffused her eyes as she exclaimed : 



EARTH REVISITED, 25 

" Dear Harold, you know me ! You are re- 
covered at last. I am so happy ! " 

Long I held her thus clasped to my heart, not 
doubting that my lost love and I were again 
united. I remembered well her appearance as 
she stood by my bedside amid my weeping rel- 
atives, and with a look of love and brightness 
beckoned me to follow her. Whence she had 
come or how I had been transported to her, I 
knew not. Certainly this fair form was no 
ethereal being. Apparently I liad not been far 
removed from the scene of my last conscious 
existence. 

" Harold, dear," whispered the fair maiden, 
while tears of joy glittered in her large, lustrous 
eyes as she pushed back my hair with a loving 
hand and looked more closely into my face, 
" Harold, you have been ill a very long 
time. You have lain unconscious many weeks. 
Your bodily health has been for some time 
quite restored, but your memory seems to have 
been impaired. You were not able to recollect 
anything of your past life. All its acts and 
feelings seemed to have been blotted out. 
Many days I have sat by your side, but even 
me, your rose, as you used to call me, you did 
not recognize, though you often looked at me 
most tenderly and called me dear Theresa. 
But now you know me. Now you are mine 
again. Soon you will be entirely recovered 
and we shall be so happy ! " 



26 EARTH REVISITED. 

With these words she imprinted a warm kiss 
upon my brow, and gazed upon me with a look 
of deep affection. 

" Theresa, my first and only love, my angel 
visitant, my beckoning guide," I murmured, 
" we are met again. But how did we come 
here ? Is this a dream ? " 

" This is no dream. I am called Helen — 
Helen Newcome," she replied. " But if you 
prefer to call me Theresa, that shall be my name 
to you. It is a sweet name, is it not ? You are 
mine again. But you must not talk too much 
to-day. I am overjoyed at your recovery, and 
in a few days we hope you will be quite yourself 
again. You are at lionie with those who love 
you and who will care for you until you are 
entirely well. Now, I must leave you. The 
physician made me promise not to remain too 
long. Good-bye." 

With these wcn^ds, she kissed me and turned 
to leave the room ; but 1 would not be left thus. 

" Who are you ? " I exclaimed, seizing her 
hand as slie rose. " Are you not Theresa 
Stewart, who died long ago ? Am I not Herbert 
Atherton, who lay dying, an old, worn-out man, 
a few days since ? Is not this my house ? 
Where are my wife and children ? " 

Instantly a shadow of sorrow and sympathy 
overspread her lovely face, while her fair 
fingers pressed softly on my lips as a mother 
Avould hush a tired child. 



EARTH REVISITED. 27 

"There, there/' she whispered, "say no 
more ; I have stayed too long ; your delirium 
is returning. Think no more about the past. 
I am your Theresa and will be yours forever." 
Then she glided from the room as swiftly and 
silently as she had entered, while to me her 
coming seemed as unreal and evanescent as the 
dream-visits of the past and the vision by my 
dying-bed." 

" Theresa ! Theresa ! " I exclaimed, start- 
ing toward her ; but she was gone and the door 
was closed. I was alone with my memories. I 
heeded not a word that she had said as to my 
recent illness and loss of memory. My recol- 
lection was too active and acute. Memory, 
the link of life ; the heaven of the holy, the 
scourge of the unjust ! Whether I were dead 
or alive, in this world or anotiier, my memory 
lived. I was the same man as before I breathed 
my last ; the same that I had been for fifty 
years on earth. With appalling clearness and 
convincing strength, appeared before me all 
the acts, thoughts and feelings of the past. 
Not God himself, I felt, could blot that out or 
make me other than I was. 

But between the hour when I lay dying and 
the present stretched an impassable gulf. All 
was oblivion to me. For the period of which 
memory spoke not, I had been dead ; but how 
long that period, or what the intervening events, 
I knew not and could not know. I seemed to 



28 EARTH REVISITED. 

have recovered from my illness ; but a feeling 
of youthful strength and vigor possessed me as 
unaccountable as the sight of myself which I 
had caught in the mirror. Again I sought its 
revelation. There plainly stood before it a 
man of youthful form in which appeared no 
trace of infirmity or age. 

"Who am I? Where am I? Who is 
this beautiful being calling herself Helen ? 
Where are my family and my friends?" I 
could but constantly ask myself. Physicians 
and others came and inquired as to my con- 
dition, and sought to minister to my health. 
But I told them I was perfectly well. All I 
wanted was for them to answer my questions. 
" Where am T ? Where are my wife and chil- 
dren ? " I asked. At length the physician, 
a most kindly looking and intelligent man, 
replied : 

" You are in your own home, in the city of 
Brooklyn. You have no wife, though this 
beautiful and loving lady, Helen Newcome, hopes 
to become yours as soon as you are recovered 
from this strange illness. You may, indeed, 
congratulate yourself upon having so faith- 
ful an attendant, and upon the prospect of ob- 
taining such a lovely partner for life. Without 
her aid, we fear, you would not have recovered 
or been able to recall the lost links in your life. 
We hope you mil now soon regain your recol- 
lection, which seems to have been entirely 



EARTH REVISITED. 29 

obliterated by your accident and the resulting 
brain fever. I have known loss of memory to 
result from a much slighter blow than yours, 
and even loss of language, so that one had to 
learn his native tongue again. Your case is 
not so bad as that, and even if your recollection 
of the past twenty years does not return, it 
will not take you long to learn all you knew. 
I do not mean to intimate that your knowledge 
was so limited," he concluded with a smile, 
"but your powers of acquisition and oppor- 
tunities are so enlarged, that you will learn 
much more rapidly than in childhood. In- 
deed, you are but a walking interrogation now, 
of a larger growth. I think I can now allow 
you to go out under the guidance of your fair 
fiancee, who will instruct and aid you much more 
successfully than I can do. You know that 
the physician's duty is not so much to admin- 
ister remedies to diseased bodies, as to prevent 
disease by conservation of the public health 
and by ministering to the minds and morals 
of the community. I now resign this case to 
Dr. Helen Newcome." 

A thousand interrogations stood on my Hps 
and in my eyes, but the doctor withdrew and 
Helen again entered. Her beauty and loveli- 
ness exceeded, if possible, those of her first 
appearance. She had the same deep brown 
eyes, the same dark curling locks, the same 
expression of innate purity and nobility of mind

that characterized my lost Theresa ; but there 
was an appearance of perfect health and grace 
in her supple form, and an inner strength and 
energy expressed in every movement, that the 
former had not possessed. Yet the look of 
love and the low sweet tones of voice were 
identical. 

"This, then, is my j^a/icee," thought I, as she 
approached and greeted me with a light and 
fragrant kiss. " Happy man ! but who am I ? " 

The thronging questions so trod upon each 
other that I stood silent. 

"Dear Harold," her sweet bell-like tones 
sounded through my very soul, "the doctor 
says I may take you out to-day for a short ride. 
Will you go with me ? The carriage is at the 
door." 

" Gladly ! " I responded. " But where is 
your team ? I see no horses." 

"This is my electric carriage," she replied. 
" Do you not know that horses are dispensed 
with ? " Then, checking herself, she continued, 
" But forgive me, Harold ; the doctor told me 
I must not excite you, but must patiently ex- 
plain what you have forgotten. I will try to 
do so, dear, if you will have patience with me." 

"You are the one who will most need 
patience to tell me what you say I have for- 
gotten and what I wish to know. First, tell 
me who am I and where am I ? " But before 
my fair physician could reply, we were speeding 



EARTH REVISITED. 81 

swiftly, yet noiselessly, in onr mimic car along 
the smooth, winding streets and avenues of a 
magnificent city such as I had never beheld, 
while I gazed about me in silent wonder. 
Along the wide and cleanly highways flew 
thousands of the swift, silent vehicles, filled 
with strong men, fair women, and gay children. 
The walks were crowded with well-dressed, 
contented artisans and benevolent-looking citi- 
zens. Beside us towered on every hand mag- 
nificent edifices from which proceeded the hum 
of industry, while everywhere within the park- 
like grounds were the comfortable homes of 
happy thousands. 

"What city is this?'* at length I gasped. 
" Surely I never saw it before.'* 

With an evident effort to conceal her disap- 

S ointment in my failure to recognize my own 
welling-place, Helen patiently explained : 
" This is Brooklyn, part of the great city of 
Columbia, comprising all the cities about New 
York Bay. The city of New York has disap- 
peared. Manhattan Island is no longer a place 
of residence. Its unfitness for such a purpose 
had long been so thoroughly demonstrated that it 
was at lengtli abandoned entirely to warehouses, 
offices, and wholesale business. Tlie whole 
island is occupied with these, the Harlem River 
being a broad channel through which the com- 
merce of the Hudson flows to join the ocean 
through the Sound. Immense wharves fringe 



32 EARTH REVISITED. 

the whole island^ built soHdly of a concrete 
substance like stone. Beautiful bridges span 
the rivers and bay in all directions, and the 
islands in the rivers and bay are the pleasure- 
ground of the people." 

" But where do all these people live ? " I 
asked, in wonder. 

^^ Within a radius of twenty miles from the 
Harlem River," replied my fair companion, 
" dwell the ten million inhabitants of the 
fairest and greatest city on the globe." 

" But what has become of New York City ? " 
I exclaimed. 

" The inhabitants of New York long since 
moved out into what was Westchester County, 
and, in the verdant region lying between the 
Hudson and the Sound, built themselves dwell- 
ings worthy of the name. Brooklyn occupies 
the whole western end of Long Island, stretch- 
ing from sea to sound, a city of elegant homes. 
The new city of Richmond occupies all of Staten 
Island, and on the New Jersey shore lies the 
city of Adelphi, comprising all those towns, 
once merely the squaUd entrepots and work- 
shops of New York, now a great and beautiful 
municipality, stretching from the Hudson to the 
Orange Mountains. These cities occupy so 
much space also for the reason that the people 
all dive in homes, not in perpendicular sHces 
of a block. It is incredible, monstrous," she 
sighed, " that once more than a million people 



EARTH REVISITED. 33 

lived on less than half of Manhattan Island. 
But what was called the tenement house and 
its twin abomination, the flat, have long since 
ceased to exist. And yet men lived, loved, 
.wedded and died in the midst of those horrors, 
without active effort to remove them." She 
paused with an involuntary shudder. 

While she had been speaking, I could but 
gaze about me with exclamations of wonder 
and delight at the strange sights before me. 
What at first appeared to be huge birds with 
broad wings were moving through the air in 
all directions with incredible velocity. A dark 
object would appear in the distant sky like a 
small bird, rapidly increase in size as it ap- 
proached, pass us with the noiseless rush of the 
eagle, and as quickly disappear. They were 
moving in every direction, alighting and aris- 
ing with the ease and grace of a swallow, then 
darting out of sight in an instant. At length 
one passed quite near us, when I discovered 
that it was a large, cylindrical air-ship filled 
with people, traveling through the air at the 
rate of a mile a second. 

" How are they propelled ? " I exclaimed in 
wonder to my guide, perceiving at once that 
the problem of aerial navigation had been 
solved. 

" On the same principle as the bird flies," 

she replied. " Given the lightness of frame 

and the power of propulsion, and the problem

and electricity the latter. The power which 
propels the aeroplane keeps it afloat One of

blowing, and put out the broad sails, which are 
shifted by levers within, as the hawk does his 
wings, and sail around as he does, in wide 
circles above the earth, beholding its dweUings 
and landscape as in a frame of gold beneath, 
while the noiseless motion is unperceived, in 
the perfection of aerial flight so long denied 
to mortals." 

" This explains," I remarked, observing the 
practical results of this invention, "this ex- 
plains how all these people can live so far 
away from the center of business, and makes 
these widespread cities possible." 

" True," she answered. " We all depend 
upon the inventor. From the time when Pro- 
metheus first drew fire from heaven, to him 
who drew electricity from the sun, the world's 
real progress has been the march of invention. 
We have light, heat and power, the great 
essentials of human existence and comfort, 
laid down at every man's door at nominal cost. 
The effect upon the public welfare has been 
incalculable. But it is by no means the chief 
factor in our condition," she concluded with a 
fond glance, " ^for man's life consists not in the 
abundance of the things which he possesses.' " 



EAETn REVISITED, 85 

"It did in my day," I replied. "At least 
we all believed so^ and acted upon that belief. 
Whatever our creeds or customs on Sunday, 
we attended strictly to business for six days 
in the week, with all our powers of mind, body 
and estate. We believed in God and the devil, 
in heaven and hell, and that in one or the 
other we should spend an endless existence. 
But we spent our days in the pursuit of phan- 
tom fortune, which we did not know how to 
enjoy when obtained, and stumbled into the 
grave, hoping for a fool's paradise beyond, which 
we~khew we did not deserve and for which we 
were entirely unprepared." 

At these words, Helen cast upon me a look 
of mingled astonishment, grief and pain. 
Tears of disappointment and deep anxiety 
stood in her eyes while in trembling tones 
she exclaimed : 

" Dear Harold, what do you mean ? Why 
do you speak to me in this manner ? ' In your 
day ' ? You have had no day but this. You 
have forgotten much, but whence do you de- 
rive these strange ideas ? Oh, Harold, what 
has so changed you? Do you not love me 
still ? " she sobbed. 

" First answer me one question, please," 
I asked, unheeding her last words, as out of 
the whirl of conflicting thoughts I sought a 
clew to the mysteries that surrounded me, 
" How long have I been ill ? " 



:]ii EAllTIl UKVISITED, 

" Nearly three montli:^., dearest. Your ac- 
cident ocuurred on March 20th, and it is now 
the 15th of June. It has been a long, weary 
time, but now at last we have you again in 
health and strength and trust you soon will 
be quite yourself again." 

" And — what-" — ^year — is — this ? " I stam- 
mered, while a nameless fear possessed me. 

" Why, it is tlie year 1992, /to bo sure. You 
certainly have not forgotten that." 

" Impossible ! " I could but gasp, as the 
memories of my past li^ rushed over me, with 
all its acts and thoughts revealed in electric 
clearness down to the closing scene of my dying 
day. " And who then am I ? " 

Tremblingly I watched her lips for the words 
whicli miglit solve the mystery. 

" You are Harold Amesbury, dearest," she 
responded witli gentle accent and endearing 
touch upon my trembling hand. " You were 
born in the year 19(55, upon the centennial 
anniversary of the battle of App(miattox. 
Your home is liere in Brooklyn. Your parents 
are not living. Two years since we met, in my 
father's laboratory — do you not remember it, 
dear ? Ours was love at first sight. Soon we 
were plighted to bo marriinl. Tlien came this 
dreadful accident. You fell from your electric 
cycle and, striking upon your head, were taken 
up unconscious. For weeks you lay in that 
state, and when you began to recover you 



EAlVril REVISITED. )M 

seemed to have lost all recollection of your past 
life. The physician said the blow had de- 
stroyed the faculty of memory, though it might 
be restored. I watched beside you many long, 
anxious days, waiting for the first tokens of 
recognition. Often you looked tenderly upon 
me and called me Theresa, while at times you 
uttered strange exclamations in regard to events 
of the last century. You had been a close 
student of that period, and the physician said 
that you had overtaxed your brain. You 
seemed to imagine yourself a citizen of the 
nineteenth century. 

" Then they hit upon the idea of trying to 
recall your faculties by favoring the illusion. 
They fitted up and arranged your room as was 
done in that age, inartistic as it seemed, and 
reg[uested me to dress in the costume of the 
period and answer to the name of the lost 
Theresa. You know the result. You have 
found her again, have you not, dear?" 

She turned upon me a look of love and 
tenderness that would have melted a heart of 
stone ; but I coldly replied : 

" Your experiment was very suc(;essful, but 
you forgot to remove the mirror." 

'' The mirror ! what was there about that? " 

" It showed me to be a young man of about 
twenty-five, instead of the broken-down man of 
fifty that I was when I died." 

" Died ! dearest, are you distracted by your

dreams ? You have not died ! You are alive 
and well, this beautiful June day, a citizen of 
this great municipality, in this glorious year of 
our Lord, 1992. Life, activity and opportunity 
are about you — and love is beside you. What 
more can you desire ? Cast off your delusions 
and be my own true, noble lover as before." 

She bowed her lovely head upon my arm and 
wept with soft, convulsive sobs, while I clung 
to her as a drowning man to his last hope of 
life amid the billows of an unknown sea. 

" Sweet girl," I whispered, " you have saved 
me. I am yours. Let us return. lean endure 
no more." 

" A brighter light than that of electricity 
has dawned upon the world," she answered 
softly. " Let us go in now." 

I re-entered my room and stood again amid 
the surroundings of the nineteeth century. ' A 
deep darkness and gloom immediately settled 
upon me, while the briglit scenes I had beheld 
seemed but the visions of a dream. Helen 
Newcome alone was real, the living link of love 
that stretched across the gi-ave. 

As I sat down my eye fell upon a copy of 
the Brooklyn Eagle. I seized it and turned to 
the date. It was June 15, 1992. The figures 
danced before my eyes and the paper dropped 
from my hands. 

" It is all a dream — ^a delusion — a deception 
of the sight ! " I exclaimed, while I looked 



EARTH REVISITED. 39 

about me for a clew to my identity. But find- 
ing none, again I took up the paper and 
eagerly scanned the news of the day, in the 
hope that I might catch some allusion to 
matters within my memory and thus dispel my 
doubts. The form and appearance of the 
paper were familiar, though there was not, as 
formerly, such a wilderness of illegible type 
and profusion of words to describe nothing in 
particular. But when I turned to the editorial 
pages, I recognized the same breadth and 
eathoheity of thought and felicity of expression 
which have so long characterized that journal. 
There my eye fell upon an article devoted to the 
approaching semi-milennial celebration of the 
discovery of America. I read : " We con- 
gratulate our readers upon the fact that our 
great city of Columbia has been selected as the 
scene of the five hundredth anniversary of the 
discovery of the western world. This is espe- 
cially appropriate, as these united cities them- 
selves, with their vast populations, model ad- 
ministration, and world-famed civic and philan- 
thropic institutions are the greatest exhibition 
of the progress of the world since the first 
Columbian exposition at Chicago. Indeed, the 
choice of the latter city a century since, as the 
site of a world's fair, to which the nations were 
invited to behold the success of the American in 
possessing the earth, was an equally appropriate 
exhibition of the spirit of that age — the age of 



40 EARTU REVISITED. 

booms, of rings, and of monopolies. Much as 
we have to blush for in the exhibition of our- 
selves then made, we recall with satisfaction the 
fact that then was held the world's first Parlia- 
ment of Religions and kindred associations, 
indicative of the religious and social revolution 
of the present century. Indeed, the last decade 
of the nineteenth century may well be called 
the seed time of the twentieth. As then was 
celebrated a material progress greater than that 
of twenty centuries preceding, so now we cele- 
brate a moral, social, and political progress 
which may well be called a revolution, though 
it is but an evolution." 

I dropped the paper and endeavored to re- 
flect. My whole mind was in a whirl. But 
out of the confusion, at length came a con- 
clusion. T could no longer doubt that I, who 
had lived and died in the latter part of the 
nineteenth century, was alive and strong in the 
twentieth, a hundred years later. Into this 
new century, as I had been told, I v/as born 
twenty-seven years before. Then this strange 
accident had come to me by which those years 
were blotted out, and .the memory of my 
former life had come back to me. This I 
could no more doubt than the consciousness 
that I was alive. Indeed, the impressions 
wrought into my being by fifty years' existence 
and struggle in the world, were much more 
real than those which I had just received from 



EARTH REVISITED. 41 

the strange scenes I had witnessed. I should 
not have been surprised to see them all dis- 
appear like the mirage of the desert. " But 
even then," I reflected, " I shall remain. I 
cannot doubt my own existence. I am. My 
dying prayer has been granted. This is the 
same world that I have lived in ; but how 
changed ! What has caused the mighty trans- 
formation ? 

^^The only person in it whom I know is Helen 
Newcome. And who is she? She is the 
maiden who loved me before my illness and 
loves me still, though I remember her not. 
Plainly she cannot be Theresa, the love of my 
former life. She passed from earth before me, 
and I shall see her face no more. If she lives, 
perchance she moves in peace in some other 
sphere ; or, if in this, I know it not. She may 
have passed me to-day amid the throngs, un- 
knowing and unknown. Yet I never loved her 
as I do now, and if she be upon this earth, I 
will find her," I resolved, with the deep deter- 
mination of despairing love. 



42 EAUTH ItEVHSlTED, 



m. 



Helen Newcome and I had been engaged 
to be married; but I had forgotten it. I 
could not fail to notice her deep disappoint- 
ment in finding in me no trace of recollection 
of our former life, no remembrance of our 
love. I had not answered her last despairing 
question : " Do you still love me, Harold ? " 
Her youthful lover was no more, and in his 
place was a man of the past century — ^young, 
fresh and ignorant of the Ufe about him — but 
with all the feelings, thoughts and prejudices 
of the past clmging to him as the moss cluigs 
to the ancient rock. 

Though I had seemed to recoOTiize her at the 
moment of her first appearance, she now per- 
ceived that it was not herself for whom I called, 
but the idol of my dreams. Yet, as she was 
now my chosen companion, she hoped to win 
my love anew, though to me she was but one 
of the fair visions Avhich passed before me in 
such bewildering magnificence and beauty. 
My heart was in the past. 

Helen's home was near the center of the city 
of Brooklyn, in what was once the village of 
Jamaica. Thither she invited me, and I will- 



EARTH liEVISITED. 43 

ingly went with her. I should have been lost 
indeed without her in that once familiar town. 
The broad, shaded avenues, with pavements as 
smooth and clean as a floor; the absence of 
horses and heavy vehicles in the streets; the 
noiseless movement of the electric carriages ; 
the elegant dwellings and magnificent edifices 
which bordered the winding streets and numer- 
ous parks ; the leisurely movements of the 
people clad in comfortable arid beautiful gar- 
ments; the air of contentment and good-will 
on their countenances ; the absence of the 
rush and haste of business and of the fever of 
life and toil, of the dreadful street cries once 
so familiar, and more marked than all, of the 
contrasts of splendor and poverty, the equi- 
page of pride and the rags of the beggar, the 
palaces of "merchant princes" and the tene- 
ments of the poor, — all were indications of an 
enormous change in the world since I had 
known it. 

" Where are your Fifth Avenues and Beacon 
Streets? " I asked of my companion, as we 
rolled rapidly and silently along in our light 
carriage, guided by her fair hand ; " and where 
are your tenement quarters and your manufac- 
turing disti'icts ? " 

" Circumsjncej^ she replied, with a smile. 
" They are about you." 

"But I see no tall tenements, no palaces, 
except what seem to be public buildings, no 



44 EAHTll HEVISITEI), 

vast factories with smoking chinineysjiio steaiii- 
engines or locomotives." 

"It is for the simple reason that they do 
not exist," she answered, sweetly. " 1 cannot 
imagine them exce[)t as I have seen pictures of 
them in old prints. You forget that we burn 
no fuel, except gas ; that electric power is 
everywhere, and thus manufacturing can be 
conducted economically in many small build- 
ings ; while the improvements in machinery 
almost dispense with human labor, and enable 
the work of ten hours to be done in two. 
Electricity has revolutionized industry. But 
my father can explain these matters much 
better than 1." 

" lie cannot aflford me greater pleasure than 
your sweet presence," I replied, while a bright 
smile of hope appeared on her beautiful 
countenance. 

" My father is what you would call an 
inventor," she continued, " though Ave do not 
require the stimulus of patent monopoly and 
copyright to induce men to give their best ideas 
to the public. Their inventions and discov- 
eries are developed and published at public 
ex[)ense, and the public reaps the benefit of 
them." 

" But where are your j)oets and novelists ? " 

" We have none, ' she answered. " Men do 
not write novels, they do work. They invent 
machinery, discover new arts, develop new

ent families enjoying them with perfect freedom 
and pleasure. 

" To whom do these grounds belong ? " I 
asked my fair companion. 

" To us all," she replied, hastily, as if sur- 
prised at the question, at the same time giving 
me a sad look as she thus again perceived my 
entire f orgetf ulness of the hf e I had lived for 
a quarter of a century. 

But I remembered well the old city block 
or square, surrounded on four sides with tall 
buildings, sliced down into tenements for each 
family, with their rooms on top of each other 
and the intervening space divided by high 
fences into wretched little rectangles given up 
to cats and clothes-lines. * I recalled that even 
that space might have been made attractive, if 
the owners had been able to forget their seclu- 
siveness and remove the fences and plant trees, 
with a vase and a fountain or two, around 
which the families of the block, if no others, 
might gather and sip their tea in rural peace 
and quietness. 

But I had little time to reflect upon the past. 
We stood upon a broad portico a few feet 
above the ground, surrounding the dwelling. 
Helen pressed an electric button, the door 
opened automatically and we entered. At the 
same instant a phonographic voice welcomed 
us and announced our entrance to the family, 
while our photographs were taken and presented 



EARTH BEVISITEB. 47 

to them unperceived by us. The photography 
of colors was now a familiar art, and greatly 
contributed to the enjoyment of life. 

We entered a large room, apparently a com- 
bined library and laboratory, where Helen gave 
me a seat, and, placing her gentle hand upon 
my shoulder, said in a tender voice : — " Do you 
not recognize this place ? It was in this room 
that we first met. Here you had come to con- 
sult my father on a scientific question, and I 
came in behind you sitting in his chair and 
kissed you, thinking you were he. Don't you 
remember ? " 

A sweet blush mantled lier beautiful face, 
and anxious inquiry looked out of her deep, 
dark eyes. 

" I could endure many such mistakes," I re- 
plied, striving to evade her question with a 
compliment. But her words seemed idle fan- 
cies, as she spoke of my having been in that 
• room before, and suggested that I might recol- 
lect it. 

" I will call father," she repUed with a sigh, 
as she turned away. 

It was her last hope that her father, with his 
wide knowledge and experience of life, might 
in some way be able to recall my lost memory 
and restore me to her. 

Soon she returned with a tall, noble-looking 
man, of most benignant aspect, apparently 
about sixty years of age. But I noticed that 



48 EARTH REVISITED, 

he was neither gray nor bald, and his eye was 
as bright as a boy's. 

" My dear friend Harold, I am rejoiced to 
see you so well again," he exclaimed, grasping 
my hand with a strong pressure, and fixing a 
kindly, yet most searching look upon me. 

" Yes, I am quite well, I believe," I replied, 
looking up to him with admiring interest ; 
" though I was very ill for a long time before 
I died." 

A look of pain shot across Helen's face the 
instant I dropped those words, which touched 
me to the heart, and I determined not to refer 
to that subject again in her presence. But her 
father assumed not to notice it and continuied 
cheerfully : 

" I am glad you have come. I have missed 
you, and now that you are quite strong again, 
we may hope to resume our experiments." 

" What experiments, may I ask ? " 

" We will not discuss them now," he replied, 
turning the conversation. "I see you are not 
yet quite recovered. Did you enjoy your ride 
yesterday ? Helen tells me that you appeared 
to be much pleased." 

She had now taken her seat between us and 
turned from one to the other as we spoke, with 
an inquiring look mingled with deep solici- 
tude. 

" Yes," I replied, " I was greatly delighted 
with the strange scenes I witnessed, and much 



EARTH REVISITED. 49 

interested in the explanations and answers to 
my random remarks, given me so patiently by 
your lovely daughter. Yet I do not begin to 
comprehend the changes which have occurred 
in the world since I lived in it." 

Again that pained expression crossed Helen's 
face, while her father looked upon me with in- 
tense astonishment. He had been much con- 
cerned in my case, and had concluded that, 
though I had lost my memory, my impressions 
of a former existence were but the hallucina- 
tions of my disease from which I would recover 
with returning strength. But he was now 
deeply surprised to see that not only had I lost 
every recollection of my recent life, but I was 
so firm in my convictions as to my former state, 
that I could not avoid constant reference to it. 
He also perceived that, whether my convictions 
were correct or not, I had certainly no knowl- 
edge of recent events and was very familiar 
with those of the last century. 

I noticed Helen's disappointment as he relin- 
quished the attempt to converse with me on his 
plane of life, and felt compelled to accept me 
on mine, hoping thus to renew my lost recol- 
lection, while Helen appeared like one bewil- 
dered, floating out to sea in a rudderless boat, 
as she silently appealed first to one and then 
the other of us for the help and hope which 
we were unable to render. 

I pitied her, I admired her, but I was not

the lover of old, and she knew it. Yet she did 
not relax her kind attentions while she strove 
to conceal her grief and disappointment. 

" Father understands your case much better 
than I/' she resumed, with Avomanly tact. 
"He will readily explain what you do not 
understand, and will also be very glad to have 
a light thrown upon many dark points in the 
history of the nineteenth century, which you 
have studied so thoroughly." 

I cast a thankful look upon her for this 
graceful acceptance of the situation, and now 
that I believed myself to be received for what 
I was, I felt more free to inquire as to the 
facts about me, and to adjust myself to my 
new environment. 

Meantime, her father sat for several moments 
in silent thought, absorbed in the problem of 
life thus presented to him and the strange solu- 
tion offered, amazing in its simplicity as well 
as in its consequences. He fixed his deep, 
earnest eyes upon me as if to read my inmost 
soul, but simply said : 

" Please tell us the story of your life in the 
nineteenth century, as you imagine it." 

" I will cheerfully tell you of my life," I 
replied, " and also of my death." 

Again he fixed his piercing gaze upon me, 
but controlled his astonishment, while Helen 
looked upon me with unutterable pity. But 
turning to her father, I related the history of 



EARTH REVISITED. 51 

my life, from the standpoint at which I had 
viewed it on my death-bed. I softened many 
details in respect for Helen's presence, but 
I did not endeavor to conceal the complete 
selfishness which stamped it, nor its immense 
immorality when brought to the light of con- 
science and judged by new standards of duty. 
I described my dying reflections and the inabil- 
ity of my creed to sustain me ; my groping 
after a firm fact to which to tie my bark as I 
floated into eternity ; my dying despair and 
prayer for life, and my death. I did not men- 
tion the vision of Theresa, standing by my side 
at that hour, as I felt it was something too 
sacred to repeat to strangers, and that other- 
wise I had taxed their credulity to the utmost. 

" The next thing I remember," I concluded, 
" is being in my room here in Brooklyn, with new 
friends about me, new strength within me, and 
new life before me." 

" I cannot comprehend it," exclaimed Mr. 
Newcome. " You have had strange visions in 
your illness." 

" On the contrary," I declared, " I have related 
the simple truth. I have been a citizen of the 
nineteenth century. I was considered above 
the average of my contemporaries in the moral 
scale. I was a respected member of society 
and of the church. I was honored for the 
wealth which I had accumulated, was counted 
a Christian and considered myself one." 



52 EARTH REVISITED. 

^^ If what you say be true," replied he, dis- 
regarding my assertions, "you have indeed 
fallen upon better days. That age had a dim 
apprehension of the right way and was groping 
blindly, though earnestly and honestly, for the 
light. A few thoughtful minds discerned it, 
while the many stumbled on in darkness. But 
we now walk in its full effulgence." 

" It makes me shudder," exclaimed Helen, 
" to think of such a state of society. Harold 
has read so much about it that it has turned 
his head. He is looking backward instead of 
forward. Harold, please do not speak of these 
things again," she pleaded. 

" My child," said her father, " it is impos- 
sible for us to put ourselves in the place of a 
past generation, to see with their eyes, and 
understand with then* minds. But we are 
entered into their labors. We stand upon soil 
enriched by their toil, as we rear our dwellings 
upon the coral rocks raised from the depths of 
ocean by the remains of the builders. But 
our guest must be weary and hungry. Shall 
we not have some lunch ? " he added, seeking 
to give a lighter turn to our conversation. 

" I am neither," I replied, " except that I 
am weary of myself and hungermg for more 
knowledge of this age and its meaning." 

" But first let us eat," he answered. " We 
are not yet beyond that necessity. Man is 
what he eats, you know. [Quod est, est.) 



EARTH REVISITED, 53 

Good food well cooked and plenty of it is the 
first article in our creed. We drive out the ap- 
petite for stimulants by giving the body proper 
nourishment in a form to be easily assimilated." 

While he was speaking, Helen announced 
that lunch was ready in the adjoining room. 
I had noticed no sign of preparation, and as 
we entered, I saw no servants or waiters. We 
took our seats at a beautiful, small table, appai*- 
ently inlaid with pearl and silver. The service 
seemed to be mostly of silver, though I noticed 
a few pieces of old china on the sideboard, 
mainly for ornament. 

Helen served tea with charming ease and 
grace, while I admired and wondered. 

" May I ask," I at last remarked, " if you 
have solved the domestic problem — the most 
difBcult of all ? " 

" Nearly," she replied, with a smile. " We 
have abolished the cook. All our meals are 
prepared at a general kitchen under the super- 
vision of an experienced chefj whom we could 
not think of employing alone. Our neighbors 
within a convenient distance combine with us 
to employ him. I telephoned my order to him, 
which was promptly dispatched by pneumatic 
tube to our table. After dining, we send back 
in the same way the dishes to be washed." 

" That was the hete noir of the housekeeper 
in my day," I added. "But how do you 
avoid breakages ? " 



54 EARTH REVISITED. 

" Silver is cheaper than china," she returned, 
" and does not break. 

" All our laundry work is done in the same 
manner. I require no assistance to care for 
our rooms. It is true, eternal vigilance is the 
price of cleanliness. But we find that it is 
useless to allow our streets to be reservoirs of 
filth, and expect to keep it out of our houses. 
Our streets are now clean, and as we have no 
carpets or curtains to collect dust, the battle 
is comparatively easy. 

" No groceryman, butcher or milkman comes 
to the door. We find this method not only 
much pleasanter, but more economical than 
the former wasteful methods of distribution 
and preparation." 

" Those items alone constituted one-third of 
the cost of food," remarked her father. 

" Do you not miss the milkman's cheerful 
cry in the early morning hours, and the rattle 
of his iron cans ? " I asked. 

" I do not know what you mean," she said, 
with a puzzled look. " Please tell us ? " 

" Impossible," I replied. " Imagine the 
screams "of the locomotive or the whoop of the 
wild Indian." 

"I have never heard them, and I fail to 
imagine what you mean." 

" Have you no iceman with his pretty car- 
riage rumbUng over the cobble-stones ? " 

Again she looked puzzled. 



EAR TH REVISITED, 55 

" We use no ice," she replied. " Our 
rooms are cooled in summer by cold air, and as 
we have no food in the house until served, we 
do not need it in the kitchen. In fact we 
have no such room. We practice co-operative 
housekeeping." 

" In the past age," remarked her father, 
" individualism ran riot. The true method of 
living is not through independence, but inter- 
dependence. We are members of one family. 
Mutual confidence and assistance, instead of 
distrust and seclusion, promote the common 
welfare and individual comfort. We have 
given up the vain pursuit of happiness, and 
have set to work to make the world better. 
Our aim is to make this life easier for all men. 
He who improves the quality of food or reduces 
the cost of its production and preparation, is a 
public benefactor." 

"Now papa is on his hobby," interrupted 
Helen cheerfully. " Let us return to the 
laboratory. Father, you know, is a chemist, 
and the improvement of foods and discovery of 
new supplies is his present occupation." 

" ' He who treats of foods, treats of morals,' 
as one of your writers has well said," continued 
her father. " If I and others like me did not 
preach the ^ potato gospel,' on what fulcrum 
would you rest the lever for the elevation of 
mankind ? The work in which the merchant 
and mechanic is engaged is fully justified by 



56 EARTH REVISITED. 

its beneficence. We do not regard our lives 
as misspent unless devoted to the petty, selfish 
undertaking of saving our own souls. He who 
does the work given him to do in this world, 
as well as he knows how to do it, need not fear 
for the future." 

" But how are you compensated for your 
labors ? " I inquired with growing surprise at 
these statements, "for though the thinkers 
and philanthropists of my day expressed simi- 
lar ideas, we were so busy making money, so 
encumbered by the weight of the Old Man of 
the Sea from abroad, fixed upon our shoulders, 
that we were unable to put them into practical 
operation." 

" My researches and experiments," replied 
Mr. Newcome, " are conducted at the expense 
of the state, and the results are given to the 
public. No man who has an idea either in 
mechanics or morals, in fruit-raising or child 
culture, is justified in reserving it for his private 
benefit. He is bound to give it to the public. 
I receive a salary from the state, as my work is 
of a more general nature than that of many. 
Our chef in the kitchen is paid by the co-opera- 
tive housekeepers. All our supplies are pur- 
chased from the co-operative store. These • 
beautiful grounds which you see are owned 
and kept in order by the public in the same 
manner as the streets. The wliole city is built 
in this manner. None of the private dwellings 



EA R Tn REVISITED. 57 

are much finer than this, though some are 
larger, and none are much inferior." 

" Do you mean to say," I exclaimed in 
amazement, "that the poor are equally well 
housed and fed with the rich ?" 

" We do not have those classes, as for- 
merly," he answered. " There are no million- 
aires, no paupers, and no tramps." 

" Now I begin to doubt the reality of this 
life. Have you been able to change human 
nature ? " 

" No," he replied, calmly. " There is yet 
much selfishness and ignorance in the world. 
The change has been gradual and due to causes 
which I will endeavor to unfold to you at 
another time, though they are comparatively 
simple. Man has not ceased to be an acquisi- 
tive animal, but he has learned that he can 
obtain much more by combination than by 
competition." 

" This is certainly a great contrast to the 
Brooklyn of 1893," I could but remark, as I 
looked out of the window. " Then it was one 
of the worst ring-ridden cities in the country. 
It was noted for its ill-paved and filthy streets, 
and the asinine docility of its inhabitants, who 
allowed themselves to be plundered without 
protest." 

" True," he replied. " But one cause of the 
lack of civic pride in its citizens was doubtless 
the fact that most of them spent their waking 




58 EABTn REVISTTED. 

hours in New York, and only flew to Brooklyn 
to sleep. But the ladies, who had to live there 
by day as well as by night, at length took the 
matter in hand, spurred the city authorities to 
action, and shamed their husbands into a sense 
of their duty. Then came the movement for 
union with New York, when it was discovered 
that Brooklyn was the ' better half ' of the two, 
and its citizens awoke to a realization of its 
natural advantages and easily made it the most 
delightful dwelling-place on the continent. 
When the moral elements of the community 
became united, they were easily able to bring 
the politicians to terms, and to manage the 
affairs of the municipality in the interest of its 
inhabitants." 



IV. 



As Mr. Newcome paused, I perceived Helen's 
eyes fixed upon me with a gaze of unutterable 
tenderness and pity. Every word we spoke 
seemed to pierce her heart and widen the gulf 
between us. She had taken no interest in our 
conversation, except as it revealed at every step 
the depth of my separation from her and my 
complete identification with the past. She 
could endure it no longer. 

" Oh, father," she exclaimed, '^ why do you 
talk with Harold in this manner? Do you not 
see that he is drifting every moment farther 



EARTH REVISITED. 59 

from us, and soon will be lost altogether ? Oh, 
save him, save him, before it is too late ! " 

With a convulsive sob, she cast herself into 
her father's arms, and wept as if her hearty 
would break. I could' but be deeply touched 
at this exhibition of love and sorrow. I saw 
that I was the cause of it, though unwillingly, 
and that her tears were produced entirely by 
her love for me, and grief at the evidences of 
my mental alienation. But I could not dis- 
semble. I knew no life but the one I had lived 
a century before, and could not refrain from 
constant reference to it. I saw that both Mr. 
Newcome and his daughter really regarded my 
ideas as a mental delusion, and were conversing 
with me and explaining what I saw, only in 
hope of restoring my memory, or at least ena- 
bUng me to resume the place in life from which 
I had dropped in my last illness. 

This did not affect my conviction of my iden- 
tity, but it caused me to perceive how utterly 
I was cut off from tjie world around me, and 
to shudder with a chill as of the grave, when 
I contemplated my position and the reception 
I was likely to receive. I was either a lunatic 
or a ghost ; and of the two, men have the 
greater dread of the latter. When one is 
buried, it is the general desire that he shall re- 
main so. I saw that I was truly in need of 
sympathy and love, and here before me was one 
who loved me with all her heart, who saw in 



60 EARTH BEVISITED, 

me only her youthful lover from whom disease 
had bereft recollection, and whom with gentle 
ministrations she sought to win back to life and 
love. 

She was lovely beyond any creature I had 
ever seen. Her noble head was crowned with 
short curling locks of dark brown hair. Her 
deep dark eyes shone from an oval face of sin- 
gular refinement and purity. Her slender 
figure, clad in clinging robes of classic shape, 
seemed the embodiment of grace and beauty. 
Her inmost soul shone in her lustrous eyes, 
while her perfect sincerity and truth appeared 
in every utterance. 

I was young and the blood of youth coursed 
in my veins. Though the man of the nine- 
teenth century was in my memory, and his stern 
experiences were burnt into my soul, yet in this 
new life I could not be insensible to the influ- 
ence of youth and beauty. As " Lancelot love 
thralled," so it held me in its tender chain. I 
felt my heart melt with tenderness and pity as 
I looked upon the fair being before me, weep- 
ing in her father's arms. 

He was for once at a loss to know what to 
do or say. His alchemy had no antidote for 
tears ; his science offered no solution for the 
problem of love. Like a wise man he said 
nothing, but fondly stroked his daughter's 
lovely head, and endeavored to soothe her 
sorrow. I took her hand. I could only say : 



EARTH REVISITED. ^ 61 

" Helen, do not weep. It touelies me to the 
heart to see you grieve. Please do not weep." 

While I thus held her hand and endeavored 
to calm her tears, her father, almost unper- 
ceived, arose and left us alone. He was a wise 
man. Her head rested upon my shoulder, and 
I drew her to me. 

" Helen," I whispered, " I love you. You 
are all the world to me. I need you more than 
ever. Though I have forgotten the past, I 
love you now, and I shall love you always." 

She lifted her head, and with a sweet smile 
lighting the crystal drops in "the shining 
sluices of her eyes," said softly : " Was ever 
maid before twice wooed by the same man ? " 

" If so, oui;^love should be doubly sure and 
sweet," I answered, as I touched her fragrant 
lips with mine. 

I was happy, while angelic joy filled her fair 
features with the radiance of heaven. 

" You are the only woman I know in the 
whole world," said I. " You alone know me, 
trust me, believe in me. I could not face this 
wonderful world without your love and confi- 
dence. I should almost wish I had not come 
back to it " 

" Dear," exclaimed Helen, as she clasped her 
fair hand over my mouth, " please do not speak 
of that again to me. Let us forget the past, 
though for me it holds many sweet secrets, 
which I will tell you some day. But now let 






62 EABTU REVISITED. 

US live only for the present. We have each 
other. We care for naught else. In all this 
world are only you and I." 

I made no reply, but clasped her more 
closely. Love was again enthroned ; yet the 
shadow-^ of our lives was not removed; it was 
only driven back by tht^ wings of love. I had 
not forgotten the vision of my dreams ; but I 
perceived the futility of hoping that they would 
ever be realized. Theresa, the love of my 
youth, had long since passed from earth. She 
was gone from me forever, and existed only 
in mystic memories of the past. But here was 
this lovely creature whom I held in my arms, 
a bright reality, a fair form of flesh, whose 
heart I could feel beating near my own and 
whose sweet breath fanned my face. I was 
surprised that I had not appreciated her love- 
liness before. But the shock of my recovery 
had been so great, and the effort to adjust my- 
self to my situation had so absorbed my mind 
that she too had been but a problem to be solved. 
Now, I decided to take myself for better or for 
worse, and Helen also. A kind fortune had 
dropped me into gentle hands, and ordained 
that the first form to meet my wondering eyes 
in the new life, as well as the last in death, 
should be that of love. I shuddered as I 
thought what might have been my fate, had it 
been otherwise. Undoubtedly my mind would 
have been overtaxed, and my reason lost. 



EARTH REVISITED. 63 

How many of those considered insane may 
have had an experience like mine? But I 
would not foUoy these sad reflections. Had 
I not promised Helen to forget them and 
with her live only in the blissful present ? 
Was not that the truest wisdom ? The past is 
gone ; the future is not ours ; the present only 
we can claim. 

As I looked into Helen's deep, truthful eyes 
and saw myself reflected there, I felt that I had 
never truly Uved before. If this were but a 
dream, it was a blissful one. But it was no 
dream. Besides her sweet presence, instinct 
with life and love, I beheld the beautiful home 
in which she dwelt, the books and implements 
of her father's occupation, the instruments of 
communication by which the life of the world 
was brought into immediate contact. I saw 
without the broad windows, the wide lawns and 
abundant foliage surrounding the dwellings of 
peace, and heard the voices of happy children 
at play in unrestrained enjoyment. I was in 
fact very much alive. All my senses were 
acute and open to impressions from without, 
and my mind was alert to receive them and 
anxious to understand them. 

In the new methods of training youth, my 
mind had not been dulled and all its inquiring 
activities repressed by the means adopted to 
" educate " them. I was an animate interro- 
gation, but my friends were not unwilling to 



64 EARTH REVISITED. 

heed and answer my questions. Doubtless, they 
felt that by thus keeping my mind upon the 
present and interesting me in the world about 
me, they should most readily withdraw it from 
the past and recall my lost faculties. 

"Helen," I asked, as I looked down the 
broad avenues bordered by splendid residences 
as far as the eye could reach, " I cannot 
comprehend wha:t your father says, that there 
are now no rich and no poor." 

" Society is not constructed like a cake," she 
responded gayly, " in longitudinal layers, with 
the frosting on top ; but like a tower, the 
strong supporting the weak." 

"In the past," I remarked, "it was said 
' Every man for himself, and the devil take the 
hindmost.' It was also said, ' This is a free 
country and I will do as I please.' " 

" You seem to be doing very much as you 
please now," exclaimed Mr. Newcome, returning 
at that moment. But seeing the contentment 
in Helen's face and in mine, he asked for no 
explanations. 

" How do the poor obtain these fine 
dweUings ? " I asked, abruptly expressing the 
main question in my mind. 

" In the first place," patiently replied Mr. 
Newcome, " the grounds are owned and main- 
tained by the city, as public parks. Co-opera- 
tive banks and buildingf associations erect the 
houses. These are rented at a verv low rate. 



EARTH REVISITED. 65 

as money is abundant at two per cent, interest. 
None are so poor as to be unable to pay the 
rental, as all are provided with employment 
and fair wages. Besides^ the cost of living has 
been so reduced by improvements in agricul- 
ture, transportation and distribution, and by 
co-operation, that the humblest laborer can 
afford to live in circumstances of former 
aflfl-uence." 

" But how is it with the indolent ? " 
" The ignorant and the indolent are guided 
and impelled by public sentiment and super- 
vision to the course known to be for their own 
best interest as well as for the common good. 
Instead of allowing the individual to degrade 
himself and his family and finally become a 
public burden, through a mistaken notion of 
infringing personal liberty, the authority of the 
wise interferes to prevent poverty, idleness and 
intemperance." 

" The past generation led the way in this 
direction," he continued, unheeding my sur- 
prised exclamations, "in their public school 
system. They had a horror of interfering with 
the rights of the individual, but they did not 
hesitate to compel the ignorant and vicious to 
send his children to the common school, where 
they were taught and supplied with means of 
education at the public expense, and instructed 
in a manner over which he had no control, and 

often against his protests." 
5 



60 EABTU BEVISITEB, 

" But they proceeded on the theory," I inter- 
posed, " that the ignorant may be vicious, and 
so become a public charge, and that the inter- 
ests of the state demanded their education." 

" Precisely so," replied my friend earnestly. 
" Yet they allowed their children to grow up 
without moral training ; they permitted intem- 
perate and vicious parents to neglect and abuse 
them, and tolerated on every corner a school of 
iniquity and crime which they would not touch, 
and whose victims they w^ould not secure until 
they became obnoxious to criminal law, for fear 
of trespassing on the so-called rights of the 
individual. We shrq^ly &lt;^i2T^y ^^^^ common 
school 2^rincrj)Je to the 'p^^evention of indolence^ 
hnprovidence and wimorciUty^ as they did to 
pre/i^ent {(jnorance.'^^ 

" We had in my time," I remarked, " in addi- 
tion to our public schools and Sunday schools 
for the training of the young, our Children's 
Aid Societies, Free Kindergartens, Juvenile 
Asylums and Societies for the Prevention of 
Cruelty to Children." 

" What could be the need for such a society ?" 
interrupted Helen ; " for who would be guilty 
of cruelty to innocent, helpless children ? " 

" There was need enough for it, I assure 
you," I replied ; " and also for that beautiful 
twin, the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to 
Animals. Both w^re the children of the nine- 
teenth century — my benighted age," I con- 



EARTH liEVISITED. 67 

eluded with a smile of triumph, that I had found 
something for which to commend my contem- 
poraries. 

" They indeed had reason to be proud of 
them/' remarked Mr. Newcome, as he turned 
from a strange instrument which he hod quietly 
been adjusting, and fixed his fine eyes upon me. 
" After centuries of cruelty and oppression of 
the weak by the strong, after ages of despot- 
isms, hierarchies, aristocracies and monopolies, 
the institutions devised and efforts put forth, 
though tentatively and blindly, in the latter 
part of the nineteenth century for the benefit 
of the poor, the weak and the ignorant, will 
ever be the instruction and delight of mankind. 
It is true they missed the great principle under- 
lying it all. They sent missionaries to the 
heathen, not so much for love to the heathen, 
as to secure their own salvation. The churches 
gave charities to the poor, and secluded them- 
selves from them*: the " higher classes " patro- 
nized the " lower." The capitalist gave mites 
from his millions to build asylums and hospi- 
tals for his ill-paid employes who were unable 
to provide for themselves out of their wages. 
Caste, class and creed still ruled the world. 
They were the three kings of the Orient." 

" I must admit the truth of what you say," 
I replied, " but the spirit of individualism tlien 
so prevalent, was only the reaction from f\\Q 
paternal despotisms and religious repression 



68 EARTH BEVISITEB. 

which had hitherto prevailed in the world. 
The right of the individual was our declaration 
of independence. The American sought dis- 
tinction through success. He desired wealth, 
not merely from love of money, but in order to 
exhibit thereby his ability and influence. His 
hell was not to succeed. As honors could no 
longer be won in war, and the pursuits of litera- 
ture and science were so arduous and humble, 
while the openings for opulence and material 
achievement were so alluring, the youth of 
energy and ambition plunged into the pursuit 
of fortune as a passion. Thus wealth became 
our standard of social rank." 

" A plutocracy," replied Mr. Newcome, " is 
the weakest of all aristocracies. It can have 
no stability. It is like a pyramid poised on its 
apex, ready to be overturned at any moment. 
The possession of wealth is the poorest badge 
of distinction that can be worn. It is like the 
blue ribbon on the neck of the prize pig, only 
a sign of fatness." 

" Have you no prize pigs ? " I interposed. 

" We give our prizes," he replied, " for what 
a man is, and not for what he has. He is most 
honored who does most for his fellow-men. It 
was even so in the past. The highest honors 
were conferred upon the heroes of the Civil 
War and the philanthropist, while the selfish 
merchant died unhonored, his millions the 
booty of adventurers, ami none so poor as to 



EABTII REVISITED. 69 

reverence his memory. What a man gives 
away, he keeps ; what he keeps, he loses." 

A new light was dawning upon my mind. 
I began to realize the utter inanity of the life 
I had lived. I shuddered as I recalled it and 
could scarcely assure myself as I looked about 
me, that I indeed had an opportunity to retrieve 
its errors. Involuntarily I stretched out my 
hand toward Helen, and passed the other over 
my eyes. 

She caught my expression, and quickly turn- 
ing tenderly toward me, said in soft tones of 
sweetest cadence : " Come with me. Let us 
go out again. Father desires to continue his 
experiments, and will resume the conversation 
at another time." 

" Our friend interests me more than anything 
else can do," he replied, pressing my hand and 
giving me another searching look. " You must 
avoid too much ejffort until your mind regains 
its equilibrium." 

" I never was stronger, I assure you. I am 
so interested, so amazed by what I see and hear, 
that I cannot rest until I understand it." 

He turned away deeply perplexed, while I 
noticed Helen's hand tremble upon my arm, as 
we re-entered our vehicle. 

We were soon seated and gliding down the 
wide, winding streets, past the beautiful homes, 
amid groups of happy men, women and chil- 
dren, while my fair guide directed our swift 



70 EARTH REVISITED. 

carriage with the ease and grace of a swallow 
on the wing. I could but notice many others 
moving with equal velocity, and the great 
throngs of people in the street. 

" Nearly every one seems to keep his own 
carriage/' I remarked. " That used to be one 
of the marks of wealth and fashion." 

" It is so no longer/' she replied. " These 
light carriages cost little and the electric power 
less. All can ride who wish to. We have 
leveled down the peaks of wealth and leveled 
up the valleys of poverty, until now nearly all 
are on a vast plain of equality and affluence. 
Mere display for the sake of ostentation is 
despised. Hence it is out of fashion. The 
few who seek to seclude themselves in cliques 
and clubs, instead of being envied and imitated, 
and their doings recorded and commented 
upon, are simply ignored. Thus they fail of 
the distinction they desire and abandon their 
designs. And as their means of display are 
not superior to those of thousands of their 
fellow-citizens, the attempt is futile." 

" That reminds me," I responded, " that I 
have heard the servant girls remark that dia- 
monds and sealskin sackj were becoming too 



common." 



" They are common enough now," replied 
she, " for both are manufactured." Then she 
continued more seriously : " We have learned, 
as Emerson said, to take ourselves for better or

worse. None can be distinguished, except 
by benefits conferred upon his fellows. My 
father is for this reason greatly honored. His 
discoveries in chemistry and food production 
would have made him many times a million- 
aire if monopolized by himself. But he gives 
them freely to the public, receiving in return 
but a competence. Yet we are therewith con- 
tent and happy." 

" Who are these throngs of men passing 
us ? " I interrupted. " I have never seen such 
a multitude of men, apparently workmen and 
artisans, on the street at this time of the day, 
for it is but little after noon." 

" These are the people returning from their 
business and labor," replied my fair instructor. 
" Our working day is four hours, from eight 
o'clock until twelve. All the work is easily 
done in that time. Men do not rise early and 
toil late to amass useless wealth, and no one is 
compelled to do so in order to provide for him- 
self and family the necessaries and even lux- 
uries of life. The other half of the day is 
devoted to recreation, social and domestic inter- 
course and instruction, and in aiding those who 
may be in need of assistance." 

" Man is not naturally devoid of sympathy," 
I remarked, "but when he comes home at 
night, utterly exhausted in body and brain by 
the toil and strife of the day, and needs every 
moment for rest, that he may resume the 



72 EARTH REVISITED, 

wretched round in the morning, or when a 
woman spends her evenings in the tiresome 
frivolities of fashion, they have little time in 
which to think of their fellow-men or strength 
to alleviate their condition." 

While we were speaking we arrived before 
a vast, magnificent edifice, situated in the midst 
of a beautiful park, in which many of the 
multitude seemed to be gathering. We paused 
before it. It seemed to be constructed of a 
semi-transparent marble, with porticos and pil- 
lars, carved pediments and cornices, all sur- 
mounted by a lofty dome over which the light 
of the sun gleamed in prismatic hues, and 
through which the electric arcs within glowed 
with lambent light, giving it the appearance of ' 
an airy structure of fleecy cloud. But it was 
firm and indestructible as the earth. 

We joined the throng and entered. 

There seemed to be no aristocrats nor ple- 
beians among them. All had an air of intelli- 
gence, equality and good-will that inspired my 
confidence and respect. 

" What is this splendid building ? " I asked 
Helen. 

" It is the People's palace," she replied. " It 
is the outgrowth of a movement for an institute 
of science and art in this city, begun by some 
far-sighted friends of humanity in the last cen- 
tury, known as the Brooklyn Institute. Here 
every science and art is illustrated and taught." 



EARTH REVISITED, 73 

I soon found myself in a vast, circular hall 
into which the light glinted from the alabaster 
dome. This was apparently an immense art 
gallery. Its walls were adorned with paintings 
of all ages, while sculptures, statues and other 
works of art filled all its spaces. Other large 
rooms, seemingly without number, showed the 
products of every land and industry from the 
beginning of time, arranged in chronological 
order and in logical line of development. Not, 
as in old museums, were the products of each 
country arranged by themselves, requiring 
much time and research to pursue any subject, 
but each art was exhibited as a whole, running 
through all centuries and ages from the rudest 
beginnings, as from the log canoe to the ocean 
steamship, from the Chinese push-cart to the 
electric locomotive. 

Thus its interest and efficiency for the pur- 
poses of instruction were greatly enhanced to 
the public as well as to the specialist. 

As I wandered in wonder through the spa- 
cious galleries, the strains of an invisible orches- 
tra fell upon my ear, while in whatever direc- 
tion we traversed, they seemed to be equally 
near and distinct, and to proceed from the very 
walls as we passed. But I was too much 
engrossed with the objects about me to ask for 
an explanation. 

In one room the people were crowding with 
delight before the automatic opera. Upon a 



74 EARTH REVISITED. 

magnificently appointed stage appeared, in due 
succession and with lifelike action, the full- 
sized figures of the scene represented by a 
rapid succession of instantaneous photographs 
and accompanied by phonographic reproduc- 
tions of the words and music and by an invisi- 
ble orchestra, so that in all respects one beheld 
the full opera in all its magnificence, which was 
also witnessed by all with equal privilege and 
pleasure. 

In other departments were exhibited the 
inventions and mechanisms which have marked 
man's progress from barbarism to the heights 
of civilization. Here were the tom-tom of the 
Zulu, curiously carved in rude figures, and 
the grand automatic piano operated by elec- 
tricity, a hundred instruments being controlled 
by the same player ; the first cumbrous tele- 
graph instrument of Morse and the latest auto- 
matic printing telegraph, delivering printed 
messages at the rate of a thousand words a 
minute. The designers and inventors of the 
improved instruments were present, inviting 
criticisms and suggestions from all, for all felt 
that they were equally interested in the results. 
There were also reading-rooms, boys' clubs, 
gymnasia, assembly rooms and means for social 
intercourse of every kind. 

In other halls, vast audiences were listening 
to lectures and descriptions with magnificent il- 
lustrations produced by a means entirely new to 



EARTH REVISITED, 75 

me, of discoveries and researches in science and 
art, showing objects and peoi)le in motion as if 
befpre us. I was surprised again to see no 
speaker, though I could hear his voice distinctly 
in any part of the room. All seemed as if 
bringing their information and ideas to a com- 
mon center, for the common good, from which 
each took away that which he most needed for 
his own use and to complete his own discov- 
eries. It was a sort of intellectual exchange. 
There were no secrets of the trade. Each 
disclosed what he had discovered, having no 
incentive to withhold it for his private gain. 

Helen explained to me that the whole edifice 
and its exhibits were maintained by the city, 
not as formerly by private munificence. The 
sums heretofore expended in the wasteful and 
corrupt methods of municipal administration 
were found ample to provide the people's 
palace. The masses, who in the end pay the 
taxes, had determined that they should have 
the benefit of them. 

Helen was constantly at my side, explaining 
as well as possible the wonderf id scenes which 
I witnessed, but I cannot describe mv astonish- 
ment when I heard an astronomer announce 
the latest communication from the inhabitants 
of the planet Mars. 

"Can it be possible?" I asked, turning to 
my companion. 

" Oh, certainly," she replied without surprise. 



76 EARTH REVISITED. 

"Communication was established with Mars 
before I was born, by means of signals. They 
are much more advanced than we, and have 
been trying to signal to us for centuries, but 
we were so stupid and so much absorbed in our 
own petty affairs, that we did not give them 
due attention. Father will explain to you how 
it was effected." 

I stood a moment paralyzed by this dis- 
covery ; I could not comprehend it. 

" Let us go," I exclaimed. " I have seen 
enough." 

She took my arm and led me quickly away, 
with frequent glances of anxiety which betrayed 
her solicitude and love. 

A fairer, more intelligent and delightful 
companion I had never seen. I gazed upon her 
with increasing love and admiration. Yet, as 
I wandered through those throngs, another 
thought was ever present to my mind — that 
of my lost Theresa. Many of the fair young 
forms which passed me, I involuntarily scanned 
as if to see her face again, though well I knew 
that such a hope could only be in vain. 



EARTH BEVISITED. 77 



V. 



As we rolled along in our rapid vehicle on 
our return, I sat in silence and deep thought, 
pondering upon what I had seen, unable to 
find a solution to the problem of this mighty 
transformation. I knew that there could be 
no essential change in human nature; that 
selfishness and greed must exist in many 
minds ; that ignorance and indolence could 
not be entirely eradicated, and that the pas- 
sions, which Plato compares to wild beasts, 
could not be held under perfect control. Yet, 
I had seen enough to cause me to realize that 
a vast amelioration had been effected in the 
condition of mankind, at least as far as I had 
seen it. 

Some of the means by which it had been 
accomplished had been indicated by Mr. New- 
come, yet I felt that there must be a deep, 
underlying cause which I had not perceived, a 
revolution in the relations of men to each other 
and their views of life. 

I had not, however, pursued these reflections 
far, when Helen, looking before us, suddenly 
exclaimed with great animation : 

"0, there is Charley. He went out for 
a walk this morning and said he would be 



•T

back soon. I had begun to be uneasy about 
him." 

I looked, and seeing no one, asked with some 
curiosity, " Who is Charley ? Is he your 
brother ? " 

" 0, no," she rejoined with a light laugh. 
" Charley is my friend, and a very dear friend, 
too." 

"I would like to meet him," I responded, 
my interest now much increased, yet I saw no 
one. 

" Charley, this is our old friend, Harold. 
You know him, though he has forgotten you." 

Still I saw no one but a huge and handsome 
Newfoundland dog which had come up, and 
kissed her cheek with his tongue, uttering a 
series of very peculiar sharp, short, distinct 
barks in rapid succession. Then he gave me 
his foot, after wiping it on the grass, and looked 
from one to the other of us with a most intelli- 
gent expression, as if to say, " How do you do ? " 
He plainly evinced much pleasure in seeing me, 
and sympathy for me. 

" Our friend has been very ill," she con- 
tinued, speaking slowly and distinctly, while 
the dog watched intently the motions of her 
lips and the expression of her face and every 
gesture. 

Again he emitted those peculiar, staccato 
barks at regular intervals, which reminded me 
of nothing so much as the sharp click of a 



EARTH REVISITED, 79 

Morse telegraph sounder. To my astonishment, 
Helen turned to me and remarked : 

" I will translate Charley's language as you 
may not understand it. He says you don't 
seem to recognize him. But he is delighted to 
see you out again, apparently in health." 

Evidently the dog was pleased to see me. 
He showed that as clearly as other dogs do, 
but not with the same excessive demonstration. 

" Do you mean to say the dog can speak ? " 
I exclaimed. 

" Certainly," she replied, while Charley with- 
drew in an attitude of offended dignity and 
barked as before. 

" He understands what you say, but you do 
not understand his speech," she again ex- 
plained, and apologized to her no longer dumb 
friend for the ignorance and forgetfulness of 
her human friend. 

'' Impossible ! " I exclaimed. 

" ^ Impossible,' is a large word. It is no 
more difficult to teach an intelligent dog to 
speak in this manner than it was to so instruct 
the deaf and dumb, which for ages was regarded 
as impossible. Charley is neither deaf nor 
dumb. All his senses are much more acute 
than ours. My father first taught his mother 
to speak ; that is, to respond to simple ques- 
tions and make her wants known by these 
articulate barks. Thus one short bark means 
^ yes ; ' two short barks ' no.' It required great 



80 EARTH REVISITED, 

patience, but no more than is often wasted in 
teaching animals foolish tricks, which degrade 
instead of instructing them. Charley was 
taken from his birth and trained with this end 
in view. He can understand nearly all I say, 
as long as I do not mention abstract subjects 
and those beyond his experience. We have 
built up his language slowly, word by word, 
until at last the gulf is spanned between man 
and the brute, and our dumb friends can now 
communicate with us." 

"Ah!" I exclaimed in wonderment. "I 
see : it is like a telegraphic code of dots and 
dashes, or of sounds and intervals." 

" Precisely ; and to me it is no more wonder- 
ful than that in the last century young men 
and women could take off the clicks of the 
Morse instrument at thirty words a minute." 

" But there is an impassable step in human 
science," I observed, " which the lower animals 
cannot take. They cannot communicate what 
they have learned to their species and thus 
transmit and increase their knowledge." 

" The step is already taken," Helen replied, 
"though probably it could never have been 
taken alone. It is doubted whether the prim- 
eval man acquired the godlike gift of language 
unaided. Certainly his progenitor, the mimick- 
ing monkey, has not done it; but Charley's 
mother, under the patient guidance of my 
father, learned to communicate with her off- 



EARTH REVISITED. 81 

spring in that manner, and they became much 
more proficient than she. After generations 
of instruction and breeding why may not the 
dog become, not only as he long has been, the 
companion of man, but his teacher? Why 
may he not be able to communicate the hidden 
thoughts and experiences and reasonings of 
the brutes, which have hitherto been as 
unknown to us as the depths of ocean or the 
composition of the stars ? " 

I could make no reply. I simply gazed upon 
Charley with silent admiration, as we rode 
along, and he continued his conversation with 
his human friend. 

" If sympathy will regenerate the dog," she 
tflrned earnestly to me, " will it not do as much 
for men ? Human hearts are inscribed in 
sympathetic ink, •and only need warmth to 
bring out the secret writing." I could not 
reply, but I began to perceive a clue to the 
enigma of life, which had absorbed me since 
my introduction to this new world. 

As we returned to Helen's home, I noticed 
an air-ship approaching the house and pausing 
at a dome upon the roof, which I had taken to 
be a kind of astronomical observatory. 

" Do people enter your houses by the roof ? " 
I asked. 

"Yes, that is the most convenient manner," 

she responded, "when they arrive in an anemon, 

or air- vehicle." 
6 



82 EARTH REVISITED, 

" Does every man keep his own anemon, as 
well as his own carriage ? " I asked, amused. 

" All do not need them/' she replied. " They 
are used mainly for traveling long distances, 
and are mostly public conveyances in which a 
small fare is charged. Father has been to 
Boston and back since we went out." 

" What is the fare to Mars ? " I asked. " I 
would like to take a run over there and see if 
they are getting on as rapidly as we seem to 
be doing." 

She turned to me with a sad, searching look, 
as if fearing that I had not only lost my mem- 
ory, but was fast losing my wits. But soon 
perceiving that I was not in earnest, she re- 
sponded tenderly : # 

"We are not quite ready to have you leave 
this world yet. There is mc^re here that will 
interest you. Would you not like to take a 
ride in the air?" 

" I should be delighted to go anywhere 
with you," I replied. '^ I cannot well be more 
elevated than I am now." 

Helen cast upon me a look of mingled pain 
and pleasure ; pleasure at the evidence of my 
attachment to her, and pain that I could treat 
so tender a topic so lightly ; but it was merely 
the survival of the slang of the period in which 
I had lived. 

She, however, simply said : " Come with 



me. 



EARTH REVISITED. 83 

We ascended to the dome upon the roof. It 
had an opening in the side like that for a tele- 
scope. There hung a light air-vehicle. Its 
body was long and cylindrical like that of an 
enormous insect, and glistened in the sun like 
silver. I was informed that it was constructed 
of aluminum, and inflated with hydrogen gas, 
which made it exceedingly light and buoyant. 
Attached to this was a light deck, pointed at 
the ends like a cigar, and enclosed with a 
frame of aluminum and glass, forming a small 
room. 

At one end of the frame were two large 
screw wheels, like those of a steamship, but 
with much larger flanges in proportion to the 
size of the vessel. These furnished the propel- 
ing and steering power, and by stopping one 
and revolving the other, the little vehicle could 
be instantly turned in any direction, no matter 
what the force of the wind. The power was 
supplied by a small electric storage battery 
within. As this was to be merely a pleasure 
voyage, two immense canvas wings were carried. 
These were attached to levers on each side by 
which they could be instantly raised or lowered, 
turned and folded as desired. Our rise and 
descent were effected by a slight change in the 
angle of the propellers under the hand of the 
pilot, while the whole was sustained in the air 
by broad aeroplanes extending from either side 
of the cylinder. 



84 EA R TTI REVISITED. 

Helen and I entered the glass cabin and were 
shut in. In an instant we shot upward, and 
our dwelling was soon lost to sight amid the 
vast concourse of edifices beneath us. Up, up, 
we rose like a bird on the wing, so light and 
free, that I could perceive the motion only as I 
saw the city fast receding from my gaze. Now 
the city was lost to view, and beneath us 
stretched like a miniature park the groves and 
villages, the verdant fields and shining streams 
of Long Island. Then I heard the dull roar 
of the surf upon the sands and the land disap- 
peared. Nothing was to be seen but the sea 
beneath and the sky above. No motion could 
be felt. The two white wings were now put 
out, and in the gentle summer breeze we floated 
in vast circles betwixt the sea and sky, far from 
the world and all its mystery and misery. 

Helen clasped my hand as if fearing to lose 
me, and softly whispered as her head drooped 
upon my shoulder : 

" Only you and I in the universe. Is not 
this bliss ? " 

I could not reply. I was lost in wonder and 
delight. Sweet peace possessed me, the first 
I had felt in all my conscious existence. The 
world indeed had disappeared, and with me 
now was only beauty, love, and peace. How 
far away seemed now my life, with all its cares 
and toils, its doubts and difficulties ! All had 
vanished as in air. My old self was gone, and 



EARTH REVISITED, 85 

there remained only youth, hope, and love, the 
three imperishable, fixed stars in the firmament 
of Uf e. Love was around us and above us ; 
Love filled the space beneath us ; we sailed in 
its crystal sea. 

" Helen," I sighed, ^' can you forgive me ? 
I love you. I have loved you always. You 
are a part of my bmng, and though I knew it 
not, I could not exist without you. When I 
cease to love, I shall cease to live." 

" We can never die," she softly whispered 
as she pressed me to her bosom. " Love is 
immortal." 

" But Electricity has lent him new wings," 
said I, returning her embrace. 

" Love is no longer the blind archer shooting 
his shafts at random amid the throngs. He 
sees most clearly and unites only those who 
are drawn together and made one by the bonds 
of true affinity and reciprocal regard," she 
added. 

" Are we affinities ? "T asked. 

" Do you not remember that when our lips 
first met, you said you felt an electric thrill 
and an impression that we had always known 
and loved each other? " 

" Ah, that it was which awaked me from my 
long dream, as the sleeping beauty was aroused 
by the kiss of love, was it not, dearest? " 

While she blushed her reply, I imprinted 
another kiss upon her glowing cheek. 



86 EARTH-REVISITED. 

' "Do you not remember, dear/' she whis- 
pered, blushing still more deeply, " that to-day 
is the day appointed for our marriage, and this 
is the very hour ? " 

" Then why should we not be wed ? " I 
answered. " What more appropriate time or 
place ? Far from the world, with all its sin 
and care, high in heaven, we two alone in the 
universe, whose hearts are one already, in the 
presence of the God of Love, here pledge our- 
selves unto each other — not until death shall 
part — but forever." 

" Yes, I am thine forever," she responded 
sweetly, looking up with clear, far-seeing, trust- 
ing eyes, which seemed to pierce my very soul, 
which trembled at her gaze, while our lips 
sealed the solemn vow. 

We spent the afternoon in heaven. — Then, 
after the sun's red orb had sunk beneath the 
rim of the earth, we turned toward home while 
the twinkling stars came out with their nuptial 
torches to light us on our way. 

We i:eturned to the world, but we were not 
of it. As we passed its citizens, they seemed 
to us denizens of another sphere. Never more 
could we be the same as when, that summer 
afternoon, we entered the anemon to sail 
together the sea of love. Such an experience 
could not be repeated. We were united in 
the bonds of a sweet secret. Whatever life 
might hold in store for us, the past was ours ; 



EARTH REVISITED, 87 

naught could prevent our meeting in memory 
in the ship above the sea. 

As we alighted from our air-vehicle, Helen 
turned to me, ere we descended, and with a 
look of unutterable love gave me a sweet kiss 
of parting which I shall carry with me forever. 
Her face was photographed upon my heart at 
that moment in unf adingr lines. All the clouds 
of doubt and grief which afterwards came 
between us could not obscure that picture. 

I entered the laboratory where Mr. New- 
come was busy with his instruments and books. 
Turning cheerfully to me he asked if I had 
passed a pleasant afternoon. 

" The happiest of my life," I answered. 
He did not need any explanation as to the 
cause of that pleasure. He knew that his 
daughter was happy again and all the clouds 
were lifted from his heart. Though he ob- 
served that my ignorance of the world was 
as complete as ever, and I as fixed in my beliefs, 
yet he felt encouraged by my interest in what I 
saw, and he willmgly endeavored to explain all 
things to me in the hope of my final recovery. 

" What I would first like to know," I asked, 
" is how you obtain so abundant a supply of 
electricity and have it at hand for every serv- 
ice. In my day it was merely a means of 
transmitting power obtained from other sources. 
We could not generate it except in chemical 
batteries or dynamos."

gives, as the sun does, lavishly, boundlessly. 
The earth receives but one two hundred and 
twenty-seven millionth part of the sun's light 
and heat, and of that we retain but a minute 
portion in animal and vegetable Ufe, though 
every movement upon this globe is caused by 
the sun." 

I was about to inquire further as to this 
wonderful discovery when Helen entered, and, 
after an affectionate greeting to her father, 
informed him that a member of the committee 
on pubUc morals had been in and reported a 
case in which the children of a certain family 
were not receivmg proper care and training at 
home. 

" I know the case," replied her father, who 
was chairman of the committee for that part of 
the city, and turning to his desk, he wrote an 
order for the children to be removed from their 
parents for a season and placed in the Juvenile 
Home. 

" What is that ? " I asked. 

" This is merely a department of our public 
school system," he explained to me. 

" Do you mean to say," I asked in surprise, 
" that you interfere in the family to secure 
moral training ? " 

" Society has the right to take the child from 
its parents, if necessary, and train it up to be 
a useful, moral citizen," replied Mr. Newcome. 
^* Lycurgus and Plato laid down this principle 



EARTH REVISITED. 91 

as necessary for the state in order to secure its 
protection by training its children to become 
good citizens and brave soldiers. It was 
applied partially in the compulsory education 
acts and juvenile asylums. The strong arm of 
the law, that is, of the majority, is put forth to 
shield the weak and tear the innocent from the 
grasp of the cruel and immoral. We exercise 
this right universally. Here was the failure of 
the much-vaunted common school system in the 
past. It failed to give the children moral 
training, because, forsooth, the religious factions 
could not agree as to a form of religion to be 
taught, assuming that there could be no 
morality without religion. Hence their instruc- 
tion often availed only to turn out educated 
criminals. We do not find that Christian, Jew, 
or Atheist objects to having his children taught 
and trained in habits of honesty, truthfulness, 
industry, and purity. It would make no differ- 
ence if he did. We recognize that morality is 
the basis of all true civilization and the safety 
of the state, and we put forth the power of the 
public to secure it at the fountainhead. We 
do not allow children to grow up in ignorance, 
idleness, and vice, and then keep a standing 
army of police to catch them. We take the 
bird in the egg.'' 

^^ What do you do with it when you have 
caught it ? " 

" We first teach it to use all its faculties by 



92 EARTH REVISITED, 

using them ; as the old bird pushes the young 
out of the nest to make it fly. Manual and 
industrial training is a part of all schooling 
from the beginning. Every pupil, when he 
leaves the public schools, and there are no 
others, has acquired a liberal education, for he 
has learned to speak the truth, to love his 
neighbor, and to earn his living." 

" Have you no colleges or universities ? " I 
asked in surprise. 

" Not such institutions as formerly existed 
in the seclusion of scholastic shades," he 
replied. " They are all a part of the public 
school system, which in some form extends 
from the home to the workshop, from the 
cradle to the grave. The colleges are simply 
higher departments of the state system which 
includes the public schools and academies, and 
all means of educating the people. The uni- 
versities are technical institutions for the train- 
ing of specialists and for original investigation, 
but all are for the public benefit, and con- 
ducted at the public expense. One who hoards 
his knowledge is considered no better than he 
who hoards his wealth." 

" Can it be true, as father says," interrupted 
Helen, with a wondering look, "that in the 
last century men created criminals and then 
tried to catch them ? " 

She could not address me as if I were 
actually cognizant of such facts. 



EARTH REVISITED. 93 

" I .fear I must plead guilty to the indie t- 
ment," I answered, "and even more; We 
had institutions licensed for the very purpose, 
where congregated the low and vicious to take 
lessons in iniquity and conspire against the 
common peace and welfare. In fact, some of 
our great cities were practically ruled by them. 
It was the reign of the saloon and the ' boss,' 
as we called them." 

"Now he is telling us fables. Is he not, 
father ? " she exclaimed, with an incredulous 
laugh. 

" My child," he answered sadly, " there is 
too much truth in the statement. The liquor 
saloon is the enemy of society and the hot-bed 
of crime, while its cost, more than any other 
cause, has kept the people in poverty. But 
for that, the nineteenth century might have 
seen and enjoyed what we possess." 

" But why did not the people rise in their 
might," exclaimed Helen in indignation, " and 
destroy those places? " 

" When summoned to do so, we answered 
in the words of the murderer, ^Am I my 
brother's keeper ? ' " 

"But an enlightened self-interest," responded 
Mr. Newcome, " should have sufficed to exter- 
minate the saloon and overthrow the ^ boss.' " 

" How have you done it ? " I inquired 
earnestly. 

" Simply by withdrawing their support. 



94 EARTH REVISITED. 

When foreign immigration was restricted to 
the classes we desired, and the children of 
foreigners properly educated, the occupation of 
the ^ boss ' was gone. So with the saloon. We 
strangled it with restrictive legislation, let the 
drunkards die, and trained their children to the 
avoidance of alcohol and the exercise of self- 
control. Thus the liquor traffic gradually died 
from inanition. Now you may perceive how 
we can all be rich." 

VI. 

" Father," interposed Helen, who had list- 
ened somewhat impatiently to this statement 
of what were to her familiar facts, "Harold 
wishes to know what is the fare to the planet 
Mars." 

" I trust he does not intend to leave us 
soon," he lightly answered, while at the same 
time I observed his keen eye again fastened 
upon me as if doubting my mental sanity. 

" I was so greatly surprised at learning that 
communication had been established with its 
inhabitants," I replied, '^ that I should not be 
more astonished if told that you already had a 
railroad to that sphere. You have bridged the 
gulf between us and the world of life below 
us, and now have spanned the space to the 
worlds above. Pray how came it to pass ? " 

'* We have only recently had positive assur- 



EAHTll RKVISITKJK Of) 

anoe that our signals &gt;vere f)b8erve(l and 
answered," he continued. " It has hing been 
believed that the planet Mars was inhabited ; 
the contour of its land and seas^ so remarkably 
resembling ours, the white areas of snow at the 
poles melting rapidly away in their sunnu(»r, 
and its system of parallel ( anals were familiar 
to astronomers. But for many years, two 
remarkable bright spots frecpiently appearing 
and disappearing, and changing their relation 
to each other, attracted attention and suggested 
that the inhabitants were trying to signal to us. 
As the planet Mars, being exterior, is much 
older than ours, we had reason U) infer that its 
inhabitants were much wim^r and more ad- 
vanced than we, and such secerns to be tbe fact. 
** After many years we deternuncd to nispond. 
The language decided upon was tbat of 

geometry. Truth is the mime in all worlds ; 
ence we decided to construct upon our western 
Slains an immense e(|uilateral triangle. We

a hundred miles in h*ngth on each si(h5, and 
filled it with water. \V^\ rciisoned that their 
talescopes might be much more perfect than 
ours, and that tlu^y could thus more readily 
discern our signals than we tbcjirs. Such 
appeared to be tbe case, for our signal was 
instantly observed ; the bright spots disai&gt;- 
peared, and in their stead witbin a year appeared 
an equilateral triangle and, enclosing it, an 



96 EABTH REVISITED. 

immense circle of light — the symbol of all 
truth and perfection. We now know that 
their canals are constructed to carry off the 
overflow from the rapidly melting snows at 
the poles. 

" You may easily imagine our amazement 
and delight. No event, since the discovery of 
America, has so inspired the imagination and 
awakened the activity of the human mind." 

" Have you replied to them ? '* I could but 
ask in wonder. 

" We are now endeavoring to do so. We 
are preparing to flood the desert of Sahara, 
leaving in the center an immense circular 
island. We are also daily expecting new com- 
munications from them, for as they are so much 
more intelligent and active than we, they are 
obliged to do most of the signaling. It is like 
my endeavoring to teach the dog to speak. Our 
interests are not bounded by our country or 
our planet. The universe is ours." 

" I trust we may prove as docile as the dog," 
I observed. 

Upon this Charley, who had been listening 
quietly to our conversation, arose, placed his 
foot in my hand, and said " Thank you." Then 
he kissed the hands of his friends and retired. 
I, too, was ready to rest, but my mind was too 
much aroused to permit repose. 

" One more question, if you please, which I 
have been desirous of asking since you first 



EARTH REVISITED. 97 

spoke of having no millionaires and no paupers. 
What have you done with the millionaires? 
Have you hung them ? " 

" No, we have not hung them/' he replied, 
with a smile. " Neither hanging nor electric 
execution is now in vogue. We have a better 
use for men and electricity. The State has no 
more right to take human life than I have. 
We practice prevention and reformation ; not, 
however, in prisons and penitentiaries, where 
vast numbers are congregated in schools of 
crime to be turned out worse than when they 
entered, but in reform schools and local institu- 
tions, amid social surroundings and influences 
that inspire manhood and self-respect. There is 
now much less law-breaking than you might 
imagine." 

" Do you count millionaires as criminals ?" 
I repeated. 

" That depends," answered he, " altogether 
upon the use a man makes of his money. If 
he hoards it and multiplies it for his own use 
and personal power, he is looked u})on as little 
better than a criminal. If he employs ib for 
the common good, he is a public benefactor." 

"Why can any one want more money," 
exclaimed Helen, " than he can use for his 
personal comfort and pleasure? All beyond 
that is a burden and responsibility." 

" You forget, my dear," tenderly replied her 
father, " that the love of power is inborn iu

the human breast, female as well as male. 
The man who can is kmg, whether by ' divine 
right ' he wears a crown, or by inborn ability 
becomes a ' silver king ' or ' railroad magnate/ 
But it is far more difficult to become a mil- 
lionaire in these days. There are no more 
bonanzas. The great fortunes of the last 
century have long since been dissipated by 
their descendants, and we scarcely know the 
names of their possessors, except as we discover 
them in history and smile over them as you 
doubtless smiled at Midas with his ass's ears. 
Truly those men were fools. Their fortunes 
brought more burdens than pleasures. Al- 
though they could then purchase with their 
wealth what now money will not buy — honors, 
influence, position in church, state, and society, 
— ^yet true honors were always given to the 
benefactor, not to the transmitter of money." 

"How can you prevent men from hoarding 
wealth ? " I asked in surprise. 

" We have removed the strongest prop of 
property. It cannot be inherited. No gilded 
youth can now sport upon the savings of his 
dead father. No vast estates are allowed to lie 
for generations, and accumulate wealth by the 
accretion of value, given to them through the 
growth of the city, and the labor of others. 
As thrones, principalities and powers totter 
to the earth when the right of succession is 
removed, so when the right of riches to survive 



EARTH REVISITED, 99 

the tomb is denied, their value shrinks into 
comparative insignificance. Inheritance, entail 
and primogeniture, have been swept away to- 
gether into the limbo of the past. We are 
no longer ruled by the dead. A man may give 
his children all the advantages of culture and 
wealth during his life, but he cannot leave them 
more than a competence at his death. On the 
other hand, he knows that while the state — ^that 
is, the public — will not secure the propagation 
of his wealth, it will preserve his children from 
want and give them education and honorable 
employment. This also removes another strong 
incentive to accumulation, perhaps the strong- 
est." 

" Ah ! " I exclaimed in astonishment ; " I 
see you have not exterminated the millionaire; 
You have eliminated him by the process of 
survival of the fittest. Still you numbered him 
among the dangerous classes." 

" The real danger," he replied, " was not in 
the individual, but in the system." 

" Formerly we used to say ' Competition is the 
life of trade ! ' " I remarked. 

" And there was another saying employed as 
the motto of a business periodical. — ^ Formerly 
war was business ; now business is war.' I can 
but think with horror of a state of society of 
which those expressions were a characteristic 
description," responded my friend. " Business 
is not war. It is not a game in which one 



100 EARTH REVISITED. 

loses what another gains. We consider the 
man at the other end o£ the Une, and so obtain 
the greatest benefits to both." 

"Through their corporations, pools, trusts 
and labor unions, men came at last to under- 
stand that the greatest good is attained by the 
combination of all for the good of all. We all 
belong to the union now. We do not strike 
against ourselves. Instead of one class owning 
the means and implements of labor and another 
large class using them, the two classes are 
co-partners. Our industrial system, instead of 
being as formerly, an aristocracy in the midst 
of a political democracy, is true democracy : of 
the people, by the people, for the people." 

" But how do you carry on the work of the 
country ? " I inquired sceptically, considering 
the chronic distrust of the two classes for each 
other. 

" After many wasteful conflicts and blun- 
ders, all classes came to learn that their true 
interests were not antagonistic, but identical. 
The capitalist, instead of demanding the lion's 
share of the profits, was content with a mod- 
erate interest upon his investments, while he 
found that by taking the operatives into his 
confidence and copartnership, his property was 
made more secure and productive. At the 
same time, the operator learned that selfish serv- 
ice is short-sighted ; that incompetence cannot 
command the returns of skill, and that ^ char- 



» • • • 



EARTH REVISITED, 101 

acter counts for more than capital in getting a 
living/ 

" Thus gradually co-operation in manufactur- 
ing industries supplanted the wasteful and war- 
like methods of competition and combination 
of class against class. In most manufacturing 
establishments at present, the capital is loaned 
at a moderate rate of interest, secured by the 
plant and product. Superintendence and gen- 
eral management are of course more largely 
compensated than manual labor, as must always 
be the case." 

"But what have you done with the great 
transportation corporations ? " I asked. 

" The telegraph systems of the country were 
long since absorbed and operated by the post- 
office department, to the great advantage of 
both government and people," replied Mr. 
Newcome. " Letters are sent for penny pos- 
tage by either mail or wire. The railroads are 
all simply owned by the people at large, through 
the national government. Indeed, its chief 
function at present is the control of these 
public concerns. We find the happy medium 
between individual ownership of all property 
and common ownership of all property, in the 
communal ownership of certain properties and 
personal proprietorship of others. Thus the 
city owns the land, the man his house. The 
nation owns the railroads and contracts for 
carrying of freights and mails." 



102 EARTH REVISITED, 

" And what has become ofthe trade unions ? " 
I inquired. 

" They started out with a noble idea and 
aim/' he replied, " but, as you know, their 
despotism became worse than that which they 
sought to remove. They could not procure 
for the idle and incompetent the returns of the 
skillful and industi-ious. That was an attempt 
at leveling down instead of leveling up. Their 
motto was a good one, ^ The injury of one is 
the concern of all.' But a much greater, more 
beneficent truth has become the guide of the 
great Union to which we all belong. The good 
of all is the concern of each. We do not say, 
' Live and let live,' but ^ Live and help live.' We 
are all protectionists. We believe in the pro- 
tection of the poor and weak by the rich and 
powerful; the* protection of the infirm and 
unfortunate from the selfish and cruel; the 
protection of the ignorant and vicious from 
their own folly and misdoings. We have 
found that wealth is cheaper than poverty. 
Our industries, as well as our government, are 
at last purely, proudly democratic. We find 
the bettering of social conditions and industrial 
relations, not in trade unions, but in human 
fellowship, on Christian principles." 

" I rejoice to see this day," I exclaimed. 
" But what new thing have you discerned 
which has caused this revolution ?" 

" It is not a revolution, but an evolution. It 



EARTH REVISITED. 103 

is the application of the principle of ^ Love thy 
neighbor/ which gives a new nobility to labor 
and an adequate end to the common acts and 
occupations of everyday life." 

"I do not see how you have accomplished 
this ?" I remarked. " But I recall an incident 
of my childhood which seems to illustrate your 
position. One of my playmates had discovered 
a field of wild blackberries of remarkable 
abundance and richness. Instead of keeping 
his discovery to himself and endeavoring to 
gather all the fruity or forming a coterie to 
control it, he informed us all of his finding. 
Thereupon the next day we all sallied fortli 
with pail and basket, under his guidance, to 
find the new Eldorado. It was in the aban- 
doned field of a farmer, who, though he held 
the ownership of the land, did not lay claim to 
the fruit growing upon it. The berries grew 
wild, and were in fact the spontaneous gift of 
Nature. We entered the field with shouts of 
pleasure, and soon were busy filling our pails 
with the luscious fruit. The older boys soon 

fathered their baskets full, and then instead of 
urrying off, turned to the weaker and helped 
them fill theirs. I had nearly filled my pail 
when I fell over a log, spilling all my fruit, 
tearing my clothes, and scratching my face. 
But the others helped me up, sympathized with 
my misfortunes, and joining together soon 
refilled my pail, while by this exhibition of 



104 EARTH REVISITED. 

sympathy and helpfulness, I was made happier 
than before. One boy was inclined to be indo- 
lent and reclined in the shade while the others 
were at work; but when we were ready to 
return, they turned to him and stimulated him 
to go to work, offering their assistance. He 
was thus shamed into activity, and his basket 
also was soon supplied. Then we all marched 
home in pride and joy to our fond parents, with 
the results of our day's labor. Some sold their 
fruit for cash and thus converted their labor 
into money." 

" That is a perfect parallel to the industrial 
situation as we apprehend it," replied Mr. New- 
come. " The origin of property is in nature. 
The discoverer has no exclusive right to its 
possession. The ownership of land does not 
entitle one to its spontaneous product or in- 
crease of value. All mineral and natural 
wealth is the possession of the community. 
Mutual helpfulness and encouragement to the 
unfortunate and indolent, is the true method 
of acquiring and enjoying the bounties of 
nature.. They cannot be obtained without 
toil, and labor gives them their commercial 
value. No man or combination of men has the 
right to debar his fellows from the products of 
the earth. One of the writers upon tlie social- 
istic movements of the last century says of that 
age of unrest: We are moving toward a bet- 
ter, ^ a far-off, divine event ' which cannot be 



EARTH HE VIS I TED, 105 

fully perceived at present. But a century 
of progress has outlined the direction of that 
march, even as the earth itself, with the sun 
and the whole solar system, is hastening toward 
its distant, unknown goal in heaven amid the 
thronging stars." 

As Mr. Newcome paused, Helen interposed, 
with a glance of solicitous affection toward me, 

" Would you not like to have some music ? " 

"Nothing would give me greater pleasure," 
I responded gratefully, as her father withdrew. 

Thereupon she rolled out into the room a 
small, keyed apparatus differing from any musi- 
cal instrument 1 had ever seen, and began to 
play with a light, graceful movement which 
seemed scarcely to touch the keys. But im- 
mediately the most entrancing music was pro- 
duced, which was caught up seemingly by a 
hundred unseen harps and voices, responding 
in mellifluous tones of sweetest melody, echoing 
and re-echoing in dying cadences of heavenly 
harmony, until the soul was wrapped in sweet 
dreams of peace, and I floated off over the sea 
again with Helen and was lost in the infinities 
of time and space. Then her sweet voice sang : 

" Have you seen the heavenly city 
Towering through the upper air; 
All its crystal walls and towers 
Shining far, sublimely fair ? " 

As the tones of her voice died away, Helen 



1 OG EA R rn REVISITED. 

closed the instrument and seated herself beside 
me. A dim rose-colored light suffused the 
apartment ; from the open window came the 
scent of flowers and the faint sound of the great 
city lulling itself to sleep. Without speaking, 
she laid her lovely head with its short, dark 
curls upon my shoulder, and looked into my 
face with an expression of infinite love and 
trust. At that instant, while I gazed upon 
her,, and pressed her yielding form to my heart, 
I seemed to be transported to the scene of my 
former youth and to hold in my arms the form 
of my lost Theresa. The expression, the ges- 
ture, the look, were identical. Involuntarily I 
whispered the name — Theresa. At that word, 
Helen, with a slight shudder, slowly slid from 
my embrace and turned her face from me. But 
the very act was, if possible, more characteristic 
of the former love. It was inexplicable. I 
could not tell Helen of my former life and 
love ; she would not listen if I were to do so. 
Yet here was this image of the dead always 
arising between me and my living love. 
" Helen, why do you not speak to me ?" 
" That name, Theresa," she exclaimed — 
" why do you repeat it ? Can you not forget 
the delusions of your dreams ? Or if you pre- 
fer it, why do you not call me by that name, 
and not dwell upon the visions of the past ? 
Why do you not strive to recover your memory 
and cease reviewing the last century and com- 



EAR TU RE VI SI TED, 1 01 

paring it with the present ? Why dwell upon 
the phantoms of delirium now that you are 
again in health ? Are they more pleasing to 
your recollection ? Are the sins and miseries 
of the past age so pleasant a subject of contem- 
plation ? Do you prefer a dream, a vision of 
the disordered mind, to the life and love of 
reality? Do you prefer Theresa to me — a 
ghost, to a fond and living woman ? " 

As she uttered these words, she sprang to 
her feet and stood before me with flashing eyes, 
yet suffused with love and appeal ; tall, grace- 
ful and majestic as a Juno. As I looked upon 
her, my illusions vanished. I surrendered to 
the deity of love. The adoration of beauty 
had survived all my changes. I knelt at her 
feet. I clasped her knees in my arms and drew 
her toward me. 

" You, you only I love, I worship. You are 
my goddess, my all. Take me and do with me 
as you will." 

At these words an instant change came over 
her. Love, tenderness and pity melted her to 
even greater loveliness than before. Then she 
raised my head to her bosom, bathing my face 
with her kisses, and whispering : " I have taken 
you for better or for worse." Then she led me 
like a tired child to my room, and left me with 
the benediction of love and beauty on my brow.

vn. 

That night I dreamed of Theresa. Again 
she stood by my side, with the same sad, sweet 
smile that I knew so well. Many times in my 
former life has she thus come to me after a 
day of toil and strife, when the soul was 
secluded in sleep from the clamors of the day. 
She was ever young and fair, though she often 
wore a tender look of pity and reproach, because 
I had forsaken the paths of love and peace for 
a life of selfishness and strife. 

But now there was a brighter look in her 
eye, and a tone in her voice which promised 
that we might again be united and enjoy the 
life of love and peace designed for us from the 
beginning. I was to her still the youth of a 
century before, who had won her maiden love. 
But in my dreams her features seemed to be 
strangely mingled with those of Helen New- 
come. Both had the same expression of trans- 
parent truthfulness, the same eyes of crystal 
depth and purity, and the same soft, sweet 
voice. So powerful was the sense of her pres- 
ence about me, that when I awoke I could 
scarcely realize who and where I was. 

My heart was tender with love, and my eyes 
moist with tears, when the garish light of day 



EARTH REVISITED. 109 

struck upon them and awoke me to conscious- 
ness of the present. J thought " perhaps 
Theresa is in the world, and some time, some- 
where, I shall find her." As I mused, I appre- 
hended another great fact. 

" I live and I love. I shall die ; what lies 
beyond, I know not; but greater than life or 
death is the fact of love. Love is mightier 
than life. Without it, is no life. When two 
hearts join to create, there is life ; there is the 
family, society, country, civilization, religion." 

As I opened my door and descended to the 
rooms below, Helen met me, dressed as I first 
beheld her, all in maiden white, with roses in 
her hair and in her hand. A fairer, sweeter 
creature I never beheld. It was her last 
attempt to recall to my remembrance, if pos- 
sible, the incidents of our early love before the 
cloud of my misfortune had come between us. 

" Have you rested well ? " she asked in 
tender tones. 

" Splendidly," I responded ; " I feel like a 
new man. In fact I am a new man. But I fear 
you have not rested so well?" I continued, 
as I noticed a sad look in her eyes and a slight 
paleness in her cheek. 

" I dreamed of you last night, dear," she 
said in tones of sweet sadness, unheeding my 
question. " I thought that we were again in 
the anemon, you and I alone, between the sea 
and sky, and we were, oh, so happy ! Then 



110 " EARTH REVISITED. 

suddenly there was a shock and we fell, down ! 
down ! until the dark waters yawned about us. 
They engulfed us, and as you sank, I strove to 
save you. The waves seemed forms of angry 
men and wicked women, seeking to drag you 
down. You called on me : ^ Oh, Theresa, 
save me ! ' But in vain. I strove with all my 
strength, but I could not reach you. You 
sank from my sight, while I fainted in horror. 
Again I dreamed I saw you lying cold and 
lifeless on the sands, with weeping ones beside 
you, wife and children, and your features were 
strangely changed. Again I strove to reach 
you. I touched your hand and bade you rise. 
You then arose with wondering look and fol- 
lowed me ; but you had forgotten me. I led 
you through new scenes and sought to save 
you, yet you knew me not. Tears filled my 
eyes and I awoke* Oh, Harold," she sobbed, 
as she cast herself into my arms, "what does 
it mean ? " 

I cannot describe my sensations while Helen 
in tender tones related her dream. A strange 
confusion of ideas filled my mind. If I had 
ever known her before, I had certainly no 
knowledge of it. But whence could she have 
derived those ideas relating to my death and 
return to life? What could she know of my 
previous existence ? From whence had this 
vision come to her ? I did not reveal these 
thoughts to her, however, nor did I mention 



EARTH BEVISITED. Ill 

my vision of the night. It could only increase 
her sadness. I recognized her dress as one 
that she had worn when I first beheld her after 
my recovery, and I sought to divert her mind 
from her vision. 

^^ Let us not speak of dreams," I answered, 
while her deep, dark eyes looked up anxiously 
to mine. " How becoming this pure white 
dress is to you, my dear." 

^^ Do you recognize it ? " she asked, quickly. 

^^ Yes, you wore it when you first appeared 
to me after my recovery ? " 

" And had you not seen it before that? " she 
added with a voice of most earnest inquiry. 

I could not reply. There flashed across my 
mind the memory of the figure I had seen 
when I lay in delirium and for whom I called ; — 
of Theresa standing by my side as I lay dying ; — 
of the vision of the night ; but no recollection 
of Helen before the hour of my awaking. 

" I never saw one so beautiful and sweet as 
you are now," I said. " Let us not speak of 
the past. You know I promised not to do so." 

" I do not wish you to speak of that," she 
answered with a sigh, while a tremor of disap- 
pointment shook her slender frame. 

" You are ill," I exclaimed ; " let us go 



in." 



No, I am not ill; I have never been ill. 
But the shadow of my dream or some other 
cause seems to depress my spirits." 



112 EABTII liEVISITED, 

"Am I that cause?" I asked. "Why should 
you grieve if I cannot recall our first acquaint- 
ance? There was once a time when we knew 
not each other." 

" It does not seem possible/' she murmured. 
" Two souls wander through the universe led 
by invisible cords of love, until they meet and 
instantly recognize each other. It is more than 
love at first sight. It is the first sight of one 
loved long before, though unseen and undis- 
covered." 

" But we have met at last, and never more 
shall part," I added. 

" Oh, if I could feel sure of that, how happy 
I should be ; " but I am impressed that some- 
thing is drawing you away from me." 

" It is but the influence of your dream, dar- 
ling," I replied. " Forget it, and let us be 
happy while we may." 

She took my arm with a gentle touch of 
trust and confidence, smiled sweetly as she 
looked up into my face and led me into the 
park. It was June — ^the month of perfect 
days — and this was one of them. We walked 
long and lovingly through the winding paths, 
while the birds seemed to sing our songs, and 
all nature voiced the gladness of our hearts. 
Oh, that man could ever remain in Eden ! But 
the world of life lies between Paradise lost and 
Paradise regained. Infants and angels are not 
men. 



EAR TU REVISITED. 113 

An unwonted peace and quiet seemed to 
pervade the place. 

"Is this the Sabbath day?" I asked. 

"Do you take me for a Hebrew?" she 
archly answered. " We have no Sabbath. 
To-day is Sunday, the Lord's Day." 

"That is the same thing." 

"By no means," she replied. " It is a day 
of peace, not of penance. It is not the Hebrew 
fetich not the Puritan purgatory. It is a day 
of rest for all, not for part. Some do not toil 
that others may travel, either to church or 
country. It is a day of joy and of good works. 
Trains do not run to carry Monday's mail or 
Sunday newspapers. Even our meals are 
mostly prepared the day before, and conveyed 
to our tables without labor." 

" Ah ! I see, vou remember the Sabbath 
day stiU." 

" We need no command to remember the 
day of rest and peace. The Sabbath is older 
than Moses. The Jew never enjoyed it any 
more than the Puritan. It is the magna charta 
of mankind: the pledge of escape from the 
original curse. But we do not waste it in 
idleness, or weary ourselves in the vain pursuit 
of pleasure." 

" On the contrary," I remarked, " I suppose 
you go to church. To what congregation do 
you belong ? I am a Presbyterian, and would 

prefer to attend that church." 

8 



114 EARTH REVISITED, 

As I spoke, she turned upon me a look of 
amused perplexity as if unable to comprehend 
what I was saying, evidently trying to recall 
the meaning of the terms I employed. 

" You dear antediluvian/' she exclaimed. 
" Now, I do believe you have survived from 
the dark ages. There are no ch urches n or 
denominations. We have some interesting 
old buildings formerly used as sectarian places 
of assembly, but they are employed to much 
better purpose now. They are not closed for 
six days and opened for an hour or two on 
Sunday to allow the congregation to listen to 
a few hymns and a theological essay," 

" No churches ! " I exclaimed in astonish- 
ment. " Have you no house of God ; no 
heaven-pointing spires ; no tolling bells calling 
the faithful to devotion ; no pealing organ of 
solemn sound ; no long-drawn aisles shaded 
in ' dim, religious light ' ; no surpliced choirs 
intoning hymns of praise ; no gowned minister 
lifting holy hands to heaven ; no humble wor- 
shipers kneeling in solemn silence ? I think 
I would not care to live in such a world." 

" Wait and see," she answered with a smile. 
" You will behold no vain spires, nor gloomy 
aisles ; no surpliced choirs, nor barren meeting- 
houses; no humble worshipers in silks and 
velvets, serving God by proxy ; no hired repre- 
sentative repeating ancient dogmas and endeav- 
oring to delight his auditors by flights of 



EARTfl BEVISITED. 115 

oratory. Religious service is serving. Divine 
service is not performed only in churches. ' He 
that is greatest is servant of all.' " 

" But have you no church ? " I repeated. 

" We have a church, as it might be called ; 
but no churches. Could anything be more stu- 
pid, wasteful and wicked than the divisions and 
subdivisions, schisms and antagonisms of the so- 
called Christian churches of the nineteenth cen- 
tury ! Their strange substitution of theology 
for piety ; of ceremonies for service of God ; of 
denominational zeal and controversy, for re- 
ligious fervor, and of church-going for loving 
God and their neighbor, would be amusing 
were they not so tragic in their consequences. 
Even the churches of the same denomination 
in New York and Brooklyn were not able to 
join in one association. Yes, I am thankful 
we have no churches," she concluded with 
more earnestness than I had seen her exhibit on 
any other subject. * 

" But the churches did much good," I pro- 
tested. " They served God according to the 
dictates of their consciences, gave money to 
send the gospel to the heathen, and contributed 
charity to the poor." 

" Yes, they conducted ceremonies after the 
dictates of their denominations, applied an 
opiate to their consciences by sending mission- 
aries to inculcate their creeds upon the heathen, 
and built costly cathedrals from which the poor 



1 16 EAR Til BEVISITED. 

at the door were excluded. As one of the 
great philanthropists of that age said : ' There 
was a costly apparatus of meeting houses and 
preaching to save men from perdition in a 
future life, while no hand was stretched out to 
save them from the miseries of their present 
existence.' 

" In an age of corporations and combina- 
tions, the churches, repelled from each other 
by the opposite electricities of their theological 
differences, persisted in their independent and 
antagonistic methods of converting the world, 
as they called it ; planting insignificant, rival 
churches at immense loss and waste in order to 
propagate their peculiar doctrines and sectarian 
tenets, ignoring the very spirit of the age in 
which they lived, and retarding the cause which 
they sought to advance. 

" In one western state in 1891, three denomi- 
national Sunday-school missionaries established 
twenty-seven Sunday-schools at a cost of $3,800; 
while one union missionary in the same time 
established thirty-five schools at a cost of 
$700." 

" That was an institution," I interposed, 
" which labored on common-sense principles and 
in accordance with the spirit of the times. 
It was called the Sunday-school Union. I 
recall an instance, when the members of differ- 
ent denominations in a community which had 
no church refused to join in organizing a 



EARTH REVISITED. 117 

union chapel, and the outsiders united and estab- 
lished what they called a ^Sinners' Church.' 
Our wonderful new West was the strategic 
point whence the world was to be won, they said, 
yet no combined effort was made to occupy 

" It was, indeed, the seed-time of the ages, 
prepared from the foundation of the world and 
rapidly passing away; yet they allowed the 
precious days to pass in disputes as to creeds 
and confessions, in idle discussion as to the 
inspiration and authorship of the Scriptures, 
and in trials for heresy, while, according to 
their own beliefs and teachings, the masses 
were rushing to endless perdition. They sent 
missionaries to Asia, Africa, and the Islands of 
the Sea, preaching antagonistic doctrines, while 
the masses in our own country were outside the 
churches and men of every race walked their 
streets neglected and despised. One of the 
largest missionary organizations even refused 
to send as preachers, men who had doubts 
as to the eternal damnation of the unconverted 
heathen. It seems incredible now ; but we 
wiU not criticise the past. Let us consider the 
present," she concluded, with a bright smile, 
dispelling the doubts 'which her words had 
aroused in my mind. 

" Shall we go to your church ? " I asked. 

Again she appeared puzzled for a moment, 
but quickly responded : 



118 EARTH REVISITED. 

" Yes, we will go to my church." 

Again we entered our light vehicle and 
japidly sped along the smooth streets amid the 
happy throngs. The grounds and groves were 
filled with joyful children and mothers with 
their pretty babes, while the men in the streets 
seemed bent upon some errand of good, so dif- 
ferent was their expression from that impressed 
by the constant pursuit of gain. 

" Where are these people going? " I asked. 

"They are going to church," she replied 
with a smile. " But I will first take you to 
mme. 

" What is it caUed ? " 

" I might call it the Church of Brotherly 
Love," she answered. "I suppose in former 
days it would have been called the * Church of 
the Great Condescension.' " 

We alighted before a small building some- 
what plainer and less prettily surrounded than 
Helen's home, but otherwise not much different. 
It was evidently the home of a laborer. 
Numerous neatly-dressed children welcomed us 
with shouts of joy and tokens of affection for 
Helen as we entered. 

" How is your mother to-;lay ? " she anxiously 
inquired of one of the older children. " I have 
brought some few delicacies for her and will 
take them to her room." 

Then she excused herself from me, saying 
she had come to visit the sick mother and would

I 



remain a short time and read for her and ti-y 
to cheer her loneliness. 

In the meantime the father came in, a tall, 
inteUigent man of about forty years of age. 
He was evidently accustomed to tliese-visits of 
Helen's, but there was no tiaee of the luimble 
recipient of charity about him, any more than 
of condescension in hor. It was as one friend 
visiting another, by which both were equally 
benefited and pleased. • The self-respect and 
independence of the trne workman were stamped 
upon every feature. 

" Are these all your childreu ? " I inquired. 

"Yes," he replied proudly, " aud the more 
the better." 

'* Are you able to care for them easily ? " 

" I have no fears as to their maintenance and 
education while I live, or as to their care and 
trainiug in useful occupations if I should be 
taken from them. We are all brothers and 
members of oue family, aa far as provision for 
the young is concerned." 

" To what church do you belong? " I asked 
abruptly, determined to solve the enigma in 
my mind. He seemed surimsed. 

"I do not belong to any," he at length re- 
pliedinsomecoufusion. " Theehnrch belongs 
to me; that is, \n coinmou with my fellow-citi- 
zens, I do not know precisely what ynn mean," 
he concluded, as Helen returned. " To what 
church do I belong? " he asked. 



120 EARTH REVISITED. 

She smiled, but did not reply. Her friend 
then thanked her for her coming and with- 
drew. 

Helen now gathered the children about her 
and instructed them by anecdotes and stories 
of her own devising, in lessons of love, gentle- 
ness, generosity, forbearance, patience and hope ; 
illustrating all these by incidents and familiar 
facts, while I listened in wonder and delight. 
Then as we departed, she remarked that she 
had several other families to visit, and also a 
club of young girls to meet in their rooms 
which they had jointly furnished and adorned 
for their meeting-place. Here she taught 
them the elements of house-keeping, of the 
preparation of foods, the care of the sick, the 
training of cliildren, the principles of educa- 
tion, and above all, of love to others, of purity, 
truth and helpfulness. 

" This is my church," she smilingly con- 
cluded, " but if you like, we will attend the 
People's Church." 

" That is a good name," I remarked. " Who 
is your preacher?" 

" We do not preach, we practice," she re- 
plied pleasantly. I said no more, but sat silent, 
confounded by the anomaly of a church with- 
out a preacher. Presently we reached a beau- 
tiful, large edifice similar in construction to the 
Institute of Arts and Sciences which we had 
visited the previous day. This was not built 



EARTH REVISITED, 121 

by the city, but by the voluntary contributions 
of all citizens who esteemed the welfare of their 
fellow-men and desired to promote their moral 
elevation. 

Helen informed me that there were numerous 
such buildings in the city, some of the old 
churches being utilized for the purpose, though 
ill-adapted to such uses. But there is only one 
church in each city, as in the early days of 
Christianity. Each association is under the 
direction of a board of managers elected by the 
local assembly, which sends delegates to a gen- 
eral board that supervises the work of the whole 
city, and in turn is represented in the councils 
of the national conference. All are admitted 
to membership who love their fellow-men and 
desire to lead a better life. 

" But what are your creeds and doctrines ? " 
I asked in surprise. 

" Our church has no creed," replied she. 
" It is not asked what do you believe, but what 
can you do ; not what do you imagine will 
become of you after death, but how do you 
live now ; how can you make your life better, 
purer, more helpful to others. Life is not 
regarded as probation for a future existence. 
Hence we do not waste it in discussing theories 
of the hereafter or in preparations for an 
unknown state. We Avould as soon think of 
dividing into sects on the color of the hair or 
the cut of our clothes, as on questions of 



122 EAR Til BE VISITED, 

creed. Our doctrine is simply, ^ Love your 
neighbor and respect his beliefs.' " 

I made no reply. I could only listen and 
wonder. As we entered the building, I beheld 
a vast museum of the works of nature, with 
telescopes, microscopes, stereopticons and mag- 
nificent views of natural scenery spread out in a 
vast panorama, as of a landscape viewed from a 
lofty mountain ; and over all, the starry heavens 
were displayed in a manner that filled me with 
awe and admiration. The infinitely great and 
the infinitely small were pictured side by side, 
and man, — the mind comprehending all, — stand- 
ing between them, king and crown of all. 
" First know thyself ," was the unwritten ensign. 

In one department, teachers, philosophers, 
and scientists were explaining and illustrating 
the great fact that all life is one. " The phys- 
ical universe is the body of God," said the 
instructor. " He is actually present in every 
manifestation of life and force. There is no 
spiritual kingdom divorced from the natural. 
God is imminent in his creation ; not an absentee. 
Science and religion, after their long coquettish 
courtship, are at last united in holy bonds. 
Real science is true religion. Man is under the 
reign of law, aiid only by conformity to it can 
he secure peace and happiness, here or here- 
after. ^ The laws of nature are the ways of 
God. Evolution is his method.' Another said : 

" As we follow back the chain of causation 



EARTH REVISITED. 123 

from complex to simple, we come to a point 
where continuity suddenly ceases — the account- 
able invariably brings us face to face with the 
unaccountable ; certain knowledge but leads us 
ever and always to the inexplicable ; the known 
confronts us ever with the unknown. Go in 
what direction we will, the circle never returns 
within itself, but every path leads directly to 
the incomprehensible and face to face with 
this ever-recurring mystery. That same imag- 
ination which has led the man of science to 
more than one bold and noble induction must 
perforce make one more leap and ^Look up 
through nature unto nature's God.' " 

In other departments teachers were unfolding 
with intense earnestness and interest the crown- 
ing glory of creation, the moral nature of man. 
" He only can say ' I ought.' He is a god ; 
knowing~gobd from evil. He only lias the 
immortal arbiter within, saying do the right, 
abhor the evil. He only has the faculty of dis- 
tinguishing truth, of delighting in its posses- 
sion, and of developing it in his life. Only in 
the path of virtue can he obtain peace. 

" When one has apprehended the fact that 
all men are created equals so that his sense of 
sympathy impels him to grasp his neighbor's 
hand as instinctively as if he were falling, he has 
found his place in society. When he under- 
stands that he can develop his moral nature only 
by exercising its in;ipulses, he has learned his 



124 EARTH REVISITED. 

relation to God. ^ All mine is thine/ is the lan- 
guage of Christian communism. The inequali- 
ties of wealth are met, not by the violent claims 
of the poor, but by the spontaneous charity of 
the rich." 

In this department were numerous smaller 
rooms occupied by classes in which all were 
learners, all teachers. Experience was the 
guide and instructor. Here each brought his 
trials and difficulties, his weakness and igno- 
rance, for instruction and advice from those of 
greater wisdom and stronger character. By 
the interchange of experience and encourage- 
ments, all were benefited, all inspired to better 
living. Instead of abstract questions of the- 
ology or philosophy, the practical duties of 
man to man, the demands of equity, charity 
and benevolence were discussed and applied. 
Then came reports of committees who had can- 
vassed the wliole district in which this assembly 
was located, and who reported all cases of sick- 
ness or suffering, of moral lapse or stress of 
temptation which they had discovered. Then 
these principles were instantly applied by 
the appointing or volunteering of those best 
fitted to minister to the several emergencies. 
They were " doers and not hearers only." 

" But the People's Church," said Helen, ^^is 
used not only for instruction and moral inspira- 
tion, but for pleasure and recreation, domestic 
and social intercourse, throughout the week. 



EARTH REVISITED. 125 

It is the home of all, the social center of the 
community. Here the children delight to 
come, as the birds build their nests under its 
roofs and rear their young. Young men and 
maidens here learn the lessons of love, purity, 
and patience. Middle-age recounts its experi- 
ences and gains new strength for the duties of 
life. Here the old come to enjoy the society 
of the young and the sight of innocence and 
strength, while they peacefully pass their 
remaining days in the consciousness of a life 
well-spent and of a world made better for their 
having lived in it." 

" But what are your creeds and ceremonies? " 
I repeated. 

"The People's Church," she replied, "is 
based upon the principle of love, and not upon 
the speculations of philosophy or the hope 
of future rewards. Our church is wherever is 
found a brother in need ; our ' divine services' 
are done to him. We are all ministers who 
minister to the need of others. We call our- 
selves Christians, for Christ first taught us to 
love our neighbor." 

As we re-entered our light vehicle and rolled 
along the quiet streets, I sat silent in the exal- 
tation of a great discovery. 

" In addition to the great facts of life and 
love, are the greater facts of the brotherhood 
of man and the fatherhood of God ; not as fine 
phrases, but as vital, extant realities. Love, 



126 EARTH REVISITED. 

fraternity and service are the Trinity of life. 
These make life worth living and forefend the 
fear of death. From maiden-love and mother- 
love, come love of country, love of man, and 
love to the Creator. By the ladder of love we 
climb to the feet of God." 

As I gazed upon the fair being by my side, 
I could but feel an affection for her which 
would embrace mankind and an aspiration to 
make my new life one of beneficence that 
exalted me above myself. 

" Helen," I exclaimed, as we neared her 
home, " I am in love with your church." 

" And with the minister ? " she asked with 
a smile. 

" If men could have had such preachers as 
you, they would have been won to truth and 
virtue long ago," I answered. 

"If each to each be all he can 
A very god is man to man," 

she added, as we aUghted. 



vm. 

When I next saw Mr. Newcome, he invited 
me to go with him and see some of the public 
institutions of the city, to which I cheerfully 
assented. We entered our electric carriage and 
soon were speeding along the busy, yet quiet 



EARTH REVISITED. 127 

streets of the town. Our course lay toward 
the east. Few cities have been so favored 
with opportunities for growth and expansion 
as Brooklyn. With its wide, gently rolling up- 
land placed between the salt sea and the sound 
wTiere the wiuds of the tropics sweep unre- 
strained, laden with health and fragrance ; with 
dry, sandy earth, best fitted for easy and health- 
ful building, containing an inexhaustible supply 
of the purest water ; with a soil and ohmate 
fitted for producing all the fruits, flowers, and 
forests of the continent, Brooklyn was destined 
from the first to become the home of happy 
millions as well as the entrepot for the commerce 
of two worlds. The Harlem river made the 
conduit of western commerce to the sound, and 
the great ship-channel across the state, connect- 
ing the unsalted seas of tlie west with tlie 
ocean, making Cliicago and Duluth seaports, all 
combined to form great arteries of friendship 
and of trade, through which the western seas 
of billowy grain flowed to the door of the 
eastern ai-tizan, and Ids works rolled back in 
answering tokens of utility and good-will. As 
these great works had been erected at the 
national charge, and were operated at cost, the 
expense of transportation was reduced to a 
minimum and the cost of livhig lessened in pro- 
portion. Brooklyn had largely shared in these 
great benefits, and her opulent citizens liad be- 
come foremost in all good works for the in- 



128 EARTH REVISITED. 

struction and elevation of their fellow-men. Its 
Institute of Arts and Sciences, and Pratt Insti- 
tute, for instruction in useful occupations, had 
become the models for the world. 

" Such institutions are more like the King- 
dom of Heaven than all the grand cathedrals 
ever built," exclaimed my friend, as we com- 
pared the Brooklyn of the present and the past. 
" The ' city of churches,' has become the ^city 
of charities.' " 

As we conversed, we came, near the suburbs 
of the town, to a broad and beautiful park, 
occupying the former site of Garden City. The 
money of a dead millionaire, long since forgot- 
ten, had here erected a cathedral and a school. 
But now they were the scene of a beneficence, 
far greater than any he ever imagined. As 
we drew near I beheld the whole vast park 
occupied by innumerable throngs of happy 
children and their homes. Their gleeful shouts 
and gladsome songs greeted my ear as we ap- 
proached. The whole place was given up to 
the children and their attendants. 

" Is this a pleasure park, a children's play- 
ground ? " I inquired. 

"It is not a pleasure resort," replied my 
guide. " It is the Children's Home. It is 
home, school, asylum, play-ground, all in one. 
It is the center of our system of juvenile care 
and moral training. Its first object is to make 
the children happy. No labor is now done

by children. Newsboys and cash gii'ls, tbe 
■white slaves of tbe past, are found no more. 
All children whose parents are not able to eare 
for them and give them proper training-, 
are sent to thia home where they are reared 
andedncated at the general expense. All those 
also who do not receive the right moral influ- 
ence at home or who develop immoral tenden- 
cies, are sent here for discipline and care. But 
they are not crowded into the huge asylums 
of the past, good and bad together, but are 
separated into homes and companies as you 
see, under a self-governing system with general 
supervision." 

" Is it a public school ? " I asked, sui-jirised 
and pleased at what I beheld. 

" it is organized and conducted on the public 
school principle, as we recognize that the chil- 
dren are tbe foundation and the future of tbe 
state. But it is not a school. It is more like 
the kindergarten of the piist. The work of poor 
Pestalozzi, saying, 'come let us bvo for our 
children,' gathering the neglected and degraded 
little ones into his own house for eare and 
moral training, singing and dancing with them, 
sleeping and suffering mth them, dying in 
poverty and contempt for thera, has burne won- 
drons fruit. He is the children's saint. His 
statue stands at the entrance of this park, as 
you may have noticed. He is more honored 
than the millionaire, who purcliased it." 



130 EARTH REVISITED. 

" This is paradise, indeed ! " I could but 
exclaim. " Let us go in." 

We entered, and spent a most delightful and 
instructive day in the Children's Home. 

" The moral and physical development of 
the children is the chief end in view/' said 
the director. " But in order to obtain this 
they must be made happy. The individuality 
and the temperament of each child must 
be studied. In the first place, they are freed 
from outward restraint and direction. There 
are no set rules and performances. They are 
told to play and be happy. They are guided 
and restrained when necessary, but without 
their knowledge as far as possible. Every one 
knows that next to the child's instinct for play, 
is that of curiosity. This is employed to lead 
them into paths of useful knowledge ; not by 
books, but by things ; not by instruction, but 
by practice. In the same manner, moral train- 
ing is effected. You would be surprised to see 
at what an early age the deepest moral princi- 
ples are apprehended by children. Most often 
it is the selfish and immoral training they have 
had at home, which is most difficult to be 
eradicated. They learn self-control by exercis- 
ing it, love and unselfishness by its constant 
exhibition, law and order by being themselves 
part of an organized and orderly establish- 
ment." 

^^ Are not the parents of these children 



EARTH REVISITED, 131 

allowed to have any part in their moral train- 
ing ? " I asked. 

" They often need it more than the children/' 
was the reply. " The children are taken from 
those unqualified or unable to give the proper 
training to their priceless charges. Most of 
them gladly send their children here, where they 
receive this invaluable care and training without 
cost. We have also a parents' class wherein 
parents, young and old, are taught the care 
of infants and the training of children. Here 
the duties of parents are also explained, so 
that they may be practiced intelligently, instead 
of the blind experiments by which the fathers 
and the mothers of the past spent their best 
years and risked the ruin of their offspring in 
learning how to train them." 

" I see," said I to Mr. Newcome, as we 
turned away, " you have applied at the foun- 
tain-head of all society, the principles of the 
sciences that we studied and of the religion that 
we professed. What else have you done ? " 

" Come and see." 

Again we entered our light carriage and 
were whirled rapidly to another part of the city. 
There we paused before an immense edifice, or 
more properly, a collection of edifices from 
whence came up the enlivening hum of ma- 
chinery and sound of labor. As we entered, 
we beheld an army of young men and women 
engaged in the diversified occupations of the 



VVl EARTH REVISITED, 

Industrial Institute. This also was an outgrowth 
of the wise liberality of a citizen of Brooklyn in 
the nineteenth century. Here every industry and 
occupation was taught and practically applied, 
theory and practice going hand in hand. Here 
all the decorative, mechanic and domestic arts 
were taught to the young without charge. It 
was the Apprentices' College. The united work- 
men of the city had adopted and enlarged this 
institution as a part of their co-operative sys- 
tem of industry. 

" This is our industrial kindergarten/' said 
my guide. 

" How is it supported and conducted ? " I 
inquired. 

" The former suicidal jealousy of the trade 
unions towards apprentices has disappeared," 
said he. " Here any youth who desires is 
taught a useful occupation free of charge ; 
those not desiring it and dependent are placed 
here by public authority. As soon as they 
become efficient workers, they are employed in 
one of the numerous co-operative establish- 
ments and paid according to their productive 
capacity. All are thus assured employment 
and income. Each manufacturing business has 
a central selling department under skillful 
management which assures properly diversified 
productions and a market for all. If there is 
a lack of employment in any occupation, it is 
shared by all in proportion. The trades are

also tLnder similar dii-ectiou, so that wasteful 
eonipetitiim and unwise undertakings are 
avoided. A c()-opeiative bank is established by 
the savings of the -workmen, and from its profits 
the Industrial Institute is partially supported. 
A mutual insurance society is also conducted 
in eonnectiou with each trade, to which its 
members contribute a portion of their wages 
and by which they are supported in case of 
illness or age, and their families protected when 
the wage-earner is withdrawn. But as all share 
in the profits of every undertaking, all are able 
to accumulate in the mutual savings banks a pro 
vision against age and illness. Here also the 
rule of the prudent majority is enforced in re- 
gard to the indolent and improvident to impel 
them to do their own ])art towards the support 
of their families. But the foundation and bid- 
wark of the whole industrial and governmental 
system is in the training of the young in habits 
of self-control, temperance, industry and thrift, 
by which, at the same time, the demands 
- upon the industrious are diminished and the 
forces of Intelligence and order are increased. 
Furthermoie, mutual kiuiUmess, assistance and 
Bympathy are eueoiuaged and ])racticed among 
the members of aU occupations, of which this in- 
stitution is the nursery — a veritable doorway to 
the kingdom of heaven. The establLsbment of 
* The Thrift ' by Mr. Pratt has done more for the 
poor than all the trade unions ever organized." 



134 EAUTII REVISITED,' 

"This IS indeed practical philanthropy," I 
observed, as we rode away. " I remember well 
the founding of Pratt Institute, from which 
this most beneficent organization has grown. 
Have you any other such institutions ? " 

" Come with me," was again the ansv/er. 

We paused before a large and well appointed 
building in the business quarter. It appeared 
to be a mercantile establishment of some sort. 
But the only sign I saw over the door was 
" The Helping Hand — Man and Brother, Gen- 
eral Agents." As we entered, a fine-looking gen- 
tleman of benign bearing approached us, and with 
the urbanity of the most polished floorwalker 
asked : " What can we do for you to-day ? " 

" I do not wish to make any purchases 
at present," I replied, while Mr. Newcome 
smiled with ill-concealed amusement, and the 
kind gentleman gazed upon me as if in doubt 
whether I meant to perpetrate an idle jest, or 
were out of my mind. But Mr. Newcome 
simply said, " We wish to look over the place." 

I noticed, as we passed, various offices and 
rooms bearing the strange headings: "Bu- 
reau of Advice," " Law Department," " Busi- 
ness Department," " Assistance Office," "Edu- 
cational," " Confessional," " Social and Domes- 
tic." The more I looked and listened the more 
I was mystified. This was an entirely new 
enterprise to me. 

"What does this all mean?" I asked. 



EAIiTH REVISITED.

"It means," replied my guide, "that men of 
wisdom and expeiienee, wealth and sagacity, 
instead of employing theii- acquired influeuce 
for further self-aggrandizement or accumula- 
tion, here strive to employ their resources in 
rendering advice, assistance, encouragement 
and instruction to the young and struggling, the 
unfortmiate and the weak, the erring and the 
friendless. All is conducted upon true business 
principles ; not, however, the principle of ' Get all 
jou can and keep what you get,' hut that of 
' Give all you can and keep what you luuat.' 
Here those in trouble of any kind come for aid 
and advice. If oppressed or injured, they are 
referred to the Law Department, where the best 
legal advice and assistance is given gratis. 
Here the young man, just starting in bus'mess 
or choosing an occupation or profession, is 
assisted and instructed at the Business Bureau. 
Those in need of other and immediate aid, find 
it at the Assistance Office. Othei-s pursuing 
courses of reading or ]»rivate study are ad- 
vised and aided at the Etlueational Bureau." 

" But what is the Confessional ? " I inquired, 
pointing to the distant door thus labelled, half 
in fear that I might be invited to enter. 

"That is our most practical and beneficent 
department," was the reply. " All know the 
great rehef and benefit to a sin-sick soul, of 
the confessional. But aside from this, all men 
meet at times a stress of moral struggle, when

a Wise, discreet friend is the greatest earthlj 
blessings. Here such come, not to obtain 
priestly pardon for crimes committed, but for 
advice in advance, by which one may escape 
temptation or learn from past delinquencies to 
avoid the pitfalls of the future. Here a kind 
and sympathetic lady, whose hairs are whitened 
by age and suffering, invites the tempted 
woman, the struggling girl, to make known her 
sin or sorrow and find sympathy and strength. 
For young men, we find that a man of middle 
age, who knows all the feelings and temptations 
of the young, and who is not too old to feel them 
himself, yet strong and wise, is the best guide 
and counselor." 

" It is a grand and good idea, I confess," 
said Ij " and it admits of wide application in 
many walks of life. But what is the function 
of the Social and Domestic Bureau ? " 

" This is mainly for women, where they find 
advice and guidance in their numerous social 
and domestic duties, which, as only women 
know, are most wearisome and wearing. We 
do not keep an Intelligence Office or an Employ- 
ment Bureau, for their necessity is now dispensed 
with under our system of cooperative house- 
keeping and industry. This bureau has a 
much wider range. The greatest lack and evil 
of past times was the absence of social contact 
between the classes, and most particularly in 
the case of young men and women without

friends. The churches and Christian associa- 
tions suppUed it to a Umited extent, but the 
great mass of the wage-earners were not reached. 
The Working Girls' Home gave opportunity for 
social contact with each other, but that which 
they most needed, the society and friendship of 
the more cultured and intelligent, was entirely 
wanting. For lack of this, also, the young men 
of our cities were driven to the saloons and 
other evil resorts to escape the tedium of their 
toilsome lives. Now, our Social Bureau meets 
just this want. It provides means of meeting 
and of social intercourse, upon a plane of 
absolute equality, for the young and the old, 
the cultivated and the ignorant, the rich and 
the poor. In fact, these distinctions do not 
exist in the degree known in the last century. 
Our Social Bureau has been a most potent factor 
in accomplishing this change. There are now 
no ' working girls ' or ' laboring classes,' for all 
are workers. Our larger social meetings are 
held in the People's Church which all are at 
liberty to attend.

" How are all these institutions managed 
and directed ? " I asked as we' returned. 

"We have a Supervising and Connecting, 
Bureau," he replied, " similar to a telephone

thropic movement is brought into instant union. 
It is known as tlie ' Civic Center/ and is com- 
posed of the best representatives of those who 
have the welfare of the community at heart. 
It undertakes to secure that every evil shall be 
combated by all available agencies for good. 
Its cliief divisions of effort are the Religious, 
Philanthropic, Educational, Industrial, Munici- 
pal, Political and Recreative. By this means all 
the more intelligent, moral and philanthropic 
members of the community, without distinction 
of church or party, are brought into active 
union of organized effort for the repression of 
every evil and promotion of every movement 
for the improvement of the municipal, social, 
or moral condition of the people. When thus 
banded together for practical action, the moral 
forces of the community were found to be an 
irresistible engine for the destruction of evil 
and a marvelous stimulant for the growth of 
every beneficent enterprise. There was no 
lack of money or workers as soon as these re- 
sults became apparent. The organization of 
the Brotherhood of Christian Unity was the 
first step towards this mighty transformation. 
Some call it applied Clnistianity ; others, 
applied common sense." 

" Is this a new religion?" I asked, delighted 
with this exhibition. 

" Oh, no," he replied w4th a smile. " It is 
what I call Primitive Christianity. We are try-

ing to practice its precepts instead of preaching 
them. When men have learned to live by the 
mandate ' Love one another/ they can truly be 
called Christians." 

^^ You forget/' said I, " that I am a citizen 
of the nineteenth century. I cannot compre- 
hend a church without a creed." 

Mr. NewQome looked at me a moment in sur- 
prise, as if scarcely comprehending my state- 
ment, but continued. " Few can possess the 
luxury of a creed. A dogmatic statement of 
belief formulated by others, however wise, can- 
not be your behef unless you have wrought it 
out upon the anvil of your own experience. 
Hence we put it all aside, as a matter of pri- 
vate opinion, and join together on the broad 
platform of united effort for the good of our 
fellow-men." 

" But must you not have a creed or confes- 
sion as a basis of union? " I interposed. 

" Why should men think they must agree 
upon a theological theory before they can 
unite in benevolent action? A confession 
of faith cannot hold them together. But we 
have a confession of fact. It is short, but 
comprehensive :-ff-/ am not what I ought to he; 
lawjuot what TL can he; I am my hrother's 
keeper. All men who have a conscience and 
a moral nature, can subscribe to that creed." 

" A tree is known by its fruits," I remarked, 
recalling that in my day there was much

enthusiasm for what was called ^ rescue work/ 
but little application of the principle of pre- 
vention. But what has become of the Christian 
Church ? " . 

" The Christian Church/' answered Mr. New- 
come, seriously, " since the first century has* been 
the tomb of its founder." I looked up amazed 
as he paused. " But there has l^en a resur- 
rection/' he continued. " Its spirit has burst 
its cerements and come forth to a new life of 
vigor and growth, like that of its early youth. 
Christians have ceased disputing about the 
character of Christ, the plan of salvation, the 
divine decrees, and the scriptures of the Jews." 

" When did this take place ? " I asked, 
astonished. 

'^ The movement began among the laymen 
near the end of the last century. They 
had previously begun to think for themselves, 
and for a long time had listened to the 
discussions and vain sermonizing of the 
preachers with impatience. Practical business 
men began to look for a larger return for their 
investments in churches and missions." 

" Our missions were the pride of Protestant- 
ism," I interposed. 

" There were, in 1890," he went on, " one. 
hundred forty-three sects in our land based 
on doctrinal peculiarities. They employed 
twenty-six missionary organizations to make 
known the one way in Japan ; thirty-eight in

Tndia, and tliii-ty-nine in China. On business 
principles, oiie-fuurtb of the churches through- 
out the couutry were worse than useless. 
There were twenty-five thousand supernu- 
merary churches in the United States, wast- 
ing annually funds to the incredible aggregate 
of $12,500,000. At the same time, in the 
great and growiug West, the America of the near 
future, the pivotal point of Christianity, were 
immense regions without religious influences of 
any kind. In view of these facts men of sense 
and sagacity began to ask why should not all the 
den oiniiiat ions combine and form a missionary 
trust, in the manner of business corporations, 
which should expend their contributions in a 
Bjatematic manner, instead of wasting them in 
supporting weak, rival churches ? Lay con- 
gresses were convened to consider the failure 
of the churches, and to forge a closer bond of 
union between members of different denomi- 
nations. 

" The merchant went to the frontier and saw 
there such opportunities for investment in tlie 
mines of humanity that he returned full of 
enthusiasm, and redoubled his subscriptions.

around them and in their turn becoming wide- 
flowing fountains of virtue in a barren land^ 
they felt that they were at last really doing 
the work of their Master. They marveled that 
men could so long have neglected His example, 
while delving in mystical theories of His divin- 
ity, and disputing about the organization of 
a church which he never founded. People's 
churches were established everywhere. 

" Of course, some priests and prelates of 
every denomination held up their hands in 
horror, and denounced these departures from 
the fold; but others, knowing that the Church 
was a purely human institution, and remember- 
ing its history of dissension and strife, were 
not loth to see it supplanted by an edifice 
whose corner-stone was love for man, and 
whose heaven-pointing spire was love for God." 

" But are not churches necessary for our 
salvation ? " T could but ask. 

My friend looked at me a moment, curiously, 
as if not quite comprehending me. 

" The Christian Church for seventeen cen- 
turies has been teaching that the end of 
religion was to enable men to save their souls. 
Christ taught that he who seeks to save his 
soul shall lose it," he at length responded. 
" As it is not our own salvation that we are 
chiefly concerned about, we are not divided as 
to the means of obtaining it. We are striving 
not to save ourselves, but others ; not from the

future consequences of unbelief, but from 
wrongdoing and misery in this life. The 
spirit of selfishness had absorbed even the 
church. The doctrine of future rewards and 
jmuishments had reduced the service of God 
to a bargain and religion to a race for Iieaveu. 
It was a species of pious usury, which foregoes 
the pleasure of this life, for a hundred per . 
cent, hereafter. There were even those like 
Moliere's Orgon, who woiUd sacrifice his 
daughter and all his family in order to pui^ 
his own salvation. As has been well 
said, the best way in which to show our love 
to God, is to do a kindness to some of his other 
children." 

" But We had charitable institutions without 
Bumber," 1 int«r])osed. 

" They were the dawnings of a day to be," 
replied ray friend, " but they were all in the 
shadow of the lofty walls of class distinction 
which ran through all society. All were con- 
ducted at arm's length, with gloves on. The 
churches were but social clubs, and their 
Sunday-school methods puerile aud superficial 
in the extreme. The churches of the nine- 

Iteenth century were like their steam engines — 
nine-tenths of their power went up in the air. 
Our days and duties are not divided into 
religious and secular. Our religion is our 
business and our business is our religion."

was put off with our Sunday-clothes, or placed 
in pawn to be called for on our dying day, 
though some of us were unable to redeem it 
when we jnost needed it/* 

" But what has caused the breaking up of 
the churches?" I asked. 

" The prevalence of the opinion that a man 
must leave a church, because he does not agree 
with the opinions and beliefs of a majority 
of its members, did more to disintegrate the 
churches than anything else. While the theo- 
logians were engaged in heated controversy 
among themselves, in the endeavor to uphold 
their creeds and maintain their theories of the 
Bible, the masses outside looked on in scornful 
indifference. They did not even understand 
the language employed. It is most amazing 
that this state of things could have existed in 
the last quarter of the nineteenth century, 
when all the world was moving toward brother- 
hood and union with giant strides." 

" But how was Christian union finally ef- 
fected ? " I repeated incredulously. 

'' Christian union, when it came, proved not 
to be a union of churches. It was the death 
of denominations. But when once the futile 
attempt to secure uniformity of belief wa^ 
abandoned, the union of Christians was ef- 
fected without difficulty. It was not merely 
the union of church members, but of all men 
everywhere who were imbued with the Christ- 



EARTH REVISITED, 145 

like temper. But before that day, the attempt 
to continue a creed as a standard of admittance 
to church membership, had driven the best 
men out of the churches. Those who remained 
did not beUeve nor understand what their 
creeds affirmed. The Master himself would 
not have been admitted to membership in the 
church of the nineteenth century. He could 
not speak the Shibboleth of the councils and 
creed-makers." 

" What is the chief characteristic of your 
church ? " I asked, astonished. 

" It is the primitive faith as it existed before 
the theological disputes which rent the church 
and ended in the Nicene creed. The theolo- 
gians invented their own theories of salvation, 
and substituted a heaven hereafter for the 
kingdom of peace and righteousness which 
Christ came to. establish on earth. We reverse 
all that. We endeavor to apply his precepts 
in our lives. Even those who acknowledge no 
revelation and no religious authority, who en- 
deavor only to secure their own highest wel- 
fare, find it in a genuine altruism which is 
nothing else than the fulfilling of the Christian 

mandate, ' Love thy neighbor as thyself.' "

I RETURNED to my liome overwhelmed by 
what I had seen. A city without a church — 
or even with only one — was a conception so 
new, so revolutionary in its results, that I could 
scarcely comprehend it. But I had learned 
long since to bow respectfully to an accom- 
plished fact, and I could but recognize those I 
had witnessed, as among the most beautiful 
and stupendous in human history. 

As I entered the house, Helen met me with 
the old smile of love and confidence, and per- 
ceiving my weariness and abstraction, she put 
forth all her powers to please and to inspire. 
Under the blandishments of her society and 
the influence of her bright and cheering con- 
versation, I forgot my gloomy past, the sur- 
prises of the present and even my own mysteri- 
ous identity. I listened as in a blissful dream 
while she sang or played for me on her won- 
drous instrument. I heard, like far away 
music, the bell-like tones of her voice, as she re- 
lated amusing incidents of her life, with ripples 
of sweet laughter, or described with an artist's 
touch the beauties of nature and of art she had 
witnessed, now rising to flights of imagination 
and inspiration that betokened the poet and

the seer, then dropping to tones of tenderness 
and ti'Hst that revealed the virgin soul of the 
maiden lover. Filled with the memory of the 
scene I had witnessed, and with the thoughts 
and feelings of the day, soothed and sustained 
hy Helen's sweet presence and her words, yet, 
underneath all, burdened by tlie presence of 
the man that I had been, 1 retired. 

When I awoke next morning I did not know 
whether I were awake or still surrounded by 
the dread visions of the night. I saw the fa- 
miliar siirromuliugs of my roiim ; I heard the 
cheerful voices without. I saw my youthful 
face in the mirror, but the former being had 
returned. The cild man was on top. The blood 
of all my ancestorssurgedinmy veins. from the 
time when they trod the forests, club in hand, 
stealing treacherously upon tlieir victims, down 
to the days of the nineteenth century, when, in 
the warfare of trade and competition, I had 
taken the lives of my fellow-men. All the 
wolfish instincts were awake and eager for their 
prey. Avarice, ambition, greed, cruelty, selfish- 
ness, desiie, had taken possession of their foi&gt; 
mer Iiabitation. Then I realized that man is 
an animal. I was afraid of myself. I dared 
not leave my room. I felt that even Helen 
would not l»e safe from the innate animalism 
that possessed me. The very thought of her 
was maddening. By an effort of the will, T 
turned my mmd into other cliannels. I could

not think of the present. It was as a tale that 
is told, a vision that has vanished. I saw be- 
fore me the scenes of the hfe that I had lived, 
the men and women with whom I had strug- 
gled for commercial and social supremacy. I 
saw William Wilson, once a rival and competi- 
tor in my line of business. Having by misman- 
agement and misfortune got into my debt, I 
had sold him out and then taken him into my 
employment. Bankrupt and broken in spirit, 
he served me, as the captive prince walked 
chained to the chariot of the Roman conqueror, 
until liis death. He left his family, once ac- 
customed to refinement and luxury, in poverty 
and want ; but neither I nor my fellows knew 
or cared what became of them. Was it not 
every man's business to provide for his own 
family? Now, as I thought of them, I felt 
no compunctions for my course, but rather a 
stretching of the old tiger at his tether, eager 
to enter again into the conflicts and competi- 
tions of the street, to fight the bulls and de- 
vour the lambs. I remembered George Walker, 
my old bookkeeper, who had served me faith- 
fully for twenty years at bare living wages. 
What more could he want ? But one day he 
wanted more. His aged wife was ill and his 
expenses were increased. I told him that if 
he was not satisfied with his wages, he could 
look for another place. He said no more. In 
a few months his wife was buried. He began

to drink, gradually tecaine unable to attend 
to bis work, aud lost bis position. Down the 
decline of poverty and drink lie rapidly fol- 
lowed the thousands before liira, into a drunk- 
ard's grave. But that was not my business. I 
draak with inodeiatiun, and others c(mld do tbe 
same. I did not need to seek in intoxication, 
oblivion from tbe miseries of existence. I i-e- 
CiUled tbe record of man's wrong to woman— 
bis slave, bis ei-eature iu tbe past, ever the 
victim of bis sel&amp;sbness and passion, the toy of 
his tiifling hours, crushed between the upper 
and nether millstones of bis avarice and his 
self-indulgence. But none of these things 
moved me now. All tbe fau- women since Eve 

Sissed in sad procession hefi)re me — the Mater 
olorosa, weeping over tbe world — but I felt 
no pity. Yet it was not I, but the old man 
within me that uow held sway. Still I would 
not yield to bim; I knew that tbe ape and the 
tiger iu man are doomed to extinction. With 
Paul I cried, " Who shall deliver me from this 
dead body?" All day I buffeted tbe old man, 
and at even be was subdued. 

Then I felt tbe peace aud tbe confidence that 
come only to the victor. Again I could look 
my fellow-creatiu-es in the face without sbanie 
aud without desire to take advantage of tliem. 
On the contrary, I felt a wish to be of benefit 
to all my friends, and even to those whoni I 
knew not. I was now truly born again. I was

indeed a citizen of the new republic. But were 
the memories of my former life realities ? 
or was I, in part at least, the dupe of my own 
delusions ? 



XI. 



I COULD but be impressed by the fact that 
both Helen and her father had not the sUghtest 
faith in my ideas as to a former life, and that 
they were constantly striving to restore my 
recollection of the lost period, hoping that I 
would soon forget my delusions and become 
again entirely the man of the twentieth century. 
I resolved to test the matter, and settle the 
question forever. I determined to visit New 
York and see if it in any respect conformed to 
my recollection. I would endeavor to find, if 
possible, some trace of my former life in it ; or, 
on the contrary, ascertain that I was the sub- 
ject of a delusion and thus put the question to 
rest. If I were deceived, it would be made 
manifest, and I Avould henceforth endeavor to 
restrain my strange impressions and recover my 
lost identity. If, on the other hand, I should 
find my convictions sustained by indisputable 
evidence, there would be no further doubt m 
my mind, and I could have peace. Ah ! how 
greatly man's best judgment may lead him 
astray ! I was taking the very course to 
destroy my peace. Could some kindly mes-

I had not been in New York since mj re- 
covery. What I liad been told of the condition 
of Manhattan Island was sufiicient to make it 
very improbable that 1 should find anything 
there which I could recognize. 

I crossed one of the heautifid bridges which 
Bpanned the East River like a bow. The first 
Brooklyn bridge, the eighth wonder of the 
world when erected, stood unchanged, except 
that its two ugly stone towers were each crowned 
by a heroic bronze figure rejjresenting the two 
Cities stretching out their hands toward each 
other. But the union then anticipated had 
long since been effected, and the marriage had 
heen solemnized between Fattier Knickerbocker 
and Miss Brooklyn. But the beautiful arch of 
this bridge looked heavy' in comparison with 
tlie ligltt, aiiy rainbows of aluiuinuni and steel 
springing from tall metallic towers of wonderful 
grace and beauty. 

The age of utiHty had passed, and man had 
learned that uaefnlness and beauty could be 
combined with great advantage to both, while 
a dozen of these bridges were built at the cost 
of the first. 



1 52 EA R Til REVISITED. 

I crossed to New York near the old Battery 
Park. That lovely circle of green which tips 
Manhattan Island as it terminates in the silver 
waters of the bay, still remained. The hideous 
iron structures of the elevated railways no 
longer defaced it ; Avhile it was surrounded by 
the most magnificent buildings. The quaint, 
old dwellings of colonial times, remaining in 
my day, had all disappeared. I could but 
recall as I beheld it, the transitions which the 
spot had seen since its occupation by white 
men. Here first stood the old Dutch fort with 
the church within it, comprising the whole city 
of New Amsterdam. Then came the troub- 
lous times of English occupations, the plots of 
parties, and the tragic death of the patriot 
governor, Jacob Leisler. Here yet was White- 
hall Street, so named from his residence. The 
names of the streets, Uke that of sweet Echo 
were all that remained to recall the past when 
Wall Street had a barricade to keep out the 
Indians; when the City Hall Park was a "com- 
mon copw-asture Avhere Leisler was secretly 
executed, and Nassau Street, named from the 
great William of Orange, was laid out running 
from the pie-woman's to the common. 

Then came the revolutionary period when 
the wealth and fashion of the city centered 
around the Bowling Green, and Washington's 
headquarters were at the old hotel at the 
beginning of Broadway. Then Castle Garden 



EARTfl REVISITED. 153 

was erected, the opera house of the period, 
where Jenny Lind first sounded her sweet notes 
in America. Then came neglect and decay as 
the city began its march northward. 

Again in my day, came revival ; business 
centered there. The Washington hotel Avas 
replaced by the tall Washington building. The 
Produce Exchange erected their elegant edifice ; 
soon the Custom House followed, and the last 
quaint colonial dwelling disappeared. What a 
panorama now stretched before me as I looked 
out upon the incomparable bay ! One vast 
city surrounded it. The loAv-lying shores of 
New Jersey, the hills of Staten Island and of 
Brooklyn, were covered elegant edifices, while 
beautiful bridges spanned the straits and 
rivers, and, as I was informed, a network of 
tunnels under the bay and city afforded ample 
means for conveyance of freight in every direc- 
tion. 

The waters were covered with swift, strange- 
looking vessels, gliding over the surface like 
swans, and the air was alive with the bird-like 
anemons shooting across the sky, diving and 
rising like swallows. And in the midst stood 
Liberty, still enlightening and inviting the 
world. 

I was certainly in a familiar city. I re- 
membered well the day when Liberty was not 
there and the beautiful Battery Park was de^ 
serted save by the wandering emigrants who 



154 EARTH REVISITED. 

there took their first look at the western world. 
I turned and Avalked up Broadway. The street 
was not as crowded as it used to be, nor did 
the passing people bear the appearance of hav- 
ing just been thrown together from the ends 
of the earth. They seemed to be somewhat 
more homogeneous ; fused into American 
citizens. There were no cars, trucks nor horses 
in the street, and — what struck me most 
strangely — they were clean. They were in 
reality tripple-decked. Beneath the surface 
was an arcade in Avhich electric railways brought 
goods to every man's door ; they were light as 
day, and enclosed also all the electric wires, 
cables and pneumatic tubes of the city. Above 
the surface on each side of the street were what 
seemed to be light platforms or passage-ways. 
They Avere in fact traveling sidewalks, those 
on opposite sides of the streets going in oppo- 
site directions at about the rate of a man walk- 
ing. Thus one could Avalk and ride at the 
same time, and double his speed. 

The second stories of the buildings were used 
for main oiBces, Avhile the surface and lower 
stores Avere used for the reception and delivery 
of goods. There being no vehicles in the street 
except the light electric carriages, their capa- 
city for pedestrians Avas more tlian double. 

I also observed the absence of the feverish 
haste and anxiety which marked the men of 
my day in the rush of competition, and pursuit 



EARTH REVISITED. 155 

of fortune ; wlieu mon, even as they walked, 
seemed to be leaning forward to grasp the flee- 
iug phantom, and their eouversation revealed 
only their satisfaction in over-reaeliing their 
competitors or their disappointment at not 
being able to make gain out of their fellows ; 
when the api&gt;ropriate epithets of speculators 
were " bears and bulb," and their victims 
'* lambs " to be shorn. Now men had time to 
speak kindly to each other on the street, and 
to discuss matters of common welfare in busi- 
ness hours, without fear of losing a good bai- 
gain, or of advantage being taken hy a com- 
petitor. Even the expression of their counte- 
nances w;is changed. Good-will sat on every 
brow and a brotherly regard looked out of 
every ej'e. 

As I approached the site of my former 
dwelling iin intense anticipation possessed me, 
mingled with an inward feeling of hesitancy 
and dread. The Hues of the streets were not 
changed, and, as I turned into Fifth Avenue, 
I felt a strange familiarity with the scene, 
thuugli fashion and j)ride had long since taken 
their flight, and their homes were either re- 
placed hy immense warehouses or converted 
into places of trade. They were relatively in 
the humiliating position of the once fashionable 
dwellings of Beekman Street and Bleecker 
Street, though nut subjected to the same shock- 
ing degradation. 



156 EARTH REVISITED, 

My home had been on one of the cross 
streets on Murray Hill, between Fifth and Sixth 
Avenues. I had little difficulty in finding the 
site. The Cathedral still stood unchanged, but 
the millionaire's mansion opposite Avas convert- 
ed into a warehouse. At last I stood before 
my former home. Its exterior was unaltered 
except by repairs to the brown stone facing 
which had been replaced with a much more 
durable artificial stone. But the same broad 
steps were there, and above them the old gar- 
goyles stood w^ith the same ghastly grin which 
had glared on me when I last beheld them. 
What had they seen since ? Whom else had 
they seen carried down those steps ? What 
lives had lived the loved ones that I left there 
a century before ? Had they left any mark on 
their time by Avhich I could trace them ? I 
turned away sick at heart. I could not enter. 

I now realized that I had not been dream- 
ing ; my recollections were no delusions. All 
was stern reality. As I wandered through the 
peopled streets, in the greatest emporium of 
the world's commerce, amid the busy haunts of 
men, I felt more lonely than ever I had been 
before. My isolation was complete. I was in 
the world, but not of it. Yet these discoveries 
aroused in me a strong desire to learn some- 
thing of my family. I Avould know what had 
befallen them in their journey through the 
world. But where should I go for the infor- 



EAIiril HEVISITED. loT 

matioQ ? No one living knew them or could 
tell me of tliem. In ii century eveiy liuman 
beiuf^ had been swept from the face of the 
earth and its entire jiopulatiun renewed. 

I wandered on amid the throngs down the 
Bowery, ujitU I stood near the old City Uall. 
I recognized it as an old friend. Its quaint 
carvings and arched windows looked at me with 
familiar eyes, though its brown stone back, 
which was in)t expected to be seen when built, 
had been rcjiairej, and the stivtue of Bhnd Jus- 
tice on the dome, ivith scales and sword, had 
been replaced with tlie white-winged figure of 
Truth. The old revolutionary prison used as 
a register's offiee in my day had been sacrileg- 
iously removed, and in its place stood an im- 
mense building mai'ked " Hall of Records." 

"Here," thought I, "may be the mis.sing 
clue. Real estate titles are jealously guarded, 
and I have often seen them reaejiing back for 
centuries and containing, amid their dry details 
and verbose descriptions, many most interest- 
ing traces of family history." 

I entered, and. asked an old, fatherly-looking 
clerk to let me see the records. 

" If you want an abstract of title," said he, 
kindly, " why do you not go to the pubUe title 
guarantee office ? " 

" I wish to see the original deeds and devises 
relating to a lot on West Forty-eight Street," I 
said with some hesitation. "1 am not familiar 



158 EARTH BEVISITED, 

with the present methods of tracing titles. I 
am a stranger here," I added sadly, fearing 
lest I should betray my secret. But my guide, 
evidently perceiving my ignorance, readily 
proceeded to instruct me. 

" The methods of recording and searching 
titles a century ago were strangely cumbrous 
and costly," said he. " They constituted a 
serious tax on real estate, and reduced its value 
by the difficulty of its transfer. It was a relic 
of the fictitious sacredness thrown about land 
in the British law. The legal barriers inter- 
posed to its transfer were among the pillars by 
which was supported a landed aristocracy. In 
this country, the abundance of free land and 
the brevity of its possession by white men 
made its transfer much simpler. But we 
blindly followed British precedent until, in the 
latter part of the nineteenth century, the change 
from the lot to the block system and the for- 
mation of title guarantee companies greatly 
facilitated the transfer of titles and increased 
the negotiable value of real estate." 

" Yes, I remember when that was done," 
I remarked, eagerly ; but the quick glance of 
surprise from my new friend, who did not quite 
catch my meaning, warned me to withhold any 
observations of that character. 

"But that is all done at public expense 
now," he continued, " and any one can obtain 
an abstract at nominal cost. However, there 



EAnru nEVISlTKO. 1;,9 

' is little occasion for it, as the land is mostly 
owned by the city, as you know, and the users 
pay ground rent in lieu of taxes. In fact, that 
is all the tax we now require. These are 
mainly expended in public improvements, ho 
that the land rent paid in taxes is largely 
returned to those who pay it in increased 
facilities for business. All the transportation, 
lighting and telegiapii systems are operated by 
the city. Passenger travel ia fi'ee, and freight 
and messages are carried at actual cost." 

" And what is the usual land rent ? " I 
asked. Upon being informed, I exclaimed : 

" Why ! that is less than that paid in 1890 
for much inferior property." 

" Yes," replied the clerk, " because the taxes, 
instead of being expended in municipal extrava- 
gance and to support those who lived by public 
plunder, are now exj&gt;ended on public works ; 
the rate of interest is much lower also, and the 
increase in land values is distributed among the 
■whole body politic." 

"How do you effect that?" I asked in 
much surprise, remembering the immense for- 
tunes accumulated in growing cities by those 
■who did nothing but appropmte the rise in 
value of their property through the labor of 
Others. 

*' We came to the conclusion that what the 
public ]»roduces belongs to the public, and 
we took it. We began by taxing land values 



160 EARTH JiEVISITEJ). 

until we reached the whole of the increase not 
produced by actual improvements, so that all 
the unearned increment of value went into 
the public purse instead of that of a few idle 
owners. Then we taxed inheritances and 
bequests upon a graduated scale, until it became 
an advantage for a man to give away his 
property in his Ufetime. When the owners 
of vast estates found no further prospect of 
enriching themselves or their descendants out 
of the public production, they hastened to sell 
their lands which were gradually acquired by 
the city. No one wants to own land unless he 
wants to use it. They who use it, pay for the 
privilege, to the advantage of those who do 
not. 

" This is one source of the great increase in 
public wealth. Production being unchecked, 
unlimited and unmonopollzed, while consump- 
tion is limited, and an ever-increasing product 
is diffused more widely among the masses, 
there is work for all, leisure for all, and en- 
larged opportunity for all. The political econ- 
omists of the nineteenth century saw the de- 
sired end, and though differing as to the 
means of obtaining it, pointed out the path 
and made a bright beginning." 

"That was called the age of discontent," 
I interposed, remembering the agitation in my 
time concerning these subjects. 

" As usual, the golden mean was the true 



EAHTH I!KVIt&lt;ITEI&gt;. 



ItJl 



course," replied tlie clerk. " The discontent 
of the past was not only disappoiutisient with 
promising panaceas, hut an evidence of desu-e 
and deternuiiation on the part of thinking men 
to improve the condition of the masses. The 
working classes, tlien, for the first time, hatl 
leianre to perceive their condition, and their 
opportunities created desire for greater. Evils 
heretofore regarded as irremediahle had then 
become intolerable. It was the a{^e of protest 
and of search. This is the age of co-oi)eration 
and content. We are content, however, not 
because we have more, — man is neyer happy 
in having, — but becai^e what we have is more 
evenly distributed and more generally benefi- 
cial. Men find their gi-eatest good in giving." 

While I was speaking, the old clerk had 
been taking down from lofty shelves the large 
muaty records of the last century, and laying 
them before me. 

" Some of these have not been touched for 
half a century," he remarked. " Ah, you 
wanted to search against No. — West Forty- 
eighth Street. Here are the records back to ante 
be/luni times. Here is the description. You 
will be able to follow it. Here is an abstract 
of transfers down to 1950. This will show 
you where to find the other papers, wills, mort- 
•es, and so on." 

Then he left me, I was alone. With 
trembling hand I opened the huge volume of 




162 EARTH liEVISITED. 

records. What was my astonishment, when 
I saw upon the first page I opened, my own 
will/ I had forgotten it entirely. Here it 
was, copied in full, before me. " I, Harold, 
Atherton, being of sound and disposing mind, 
do hereby devise and bequeath to my dear 
wife, Henrietta, to my son Herbert and to my 
daughter Theresa, etc., etc." — I closed the 
volume and bowed my head upon it. The 
past with all its avaricious aims, its self-seek- 
ing, its loveless and unloving life, rolled over 
me. All its aims and efforts, its strivings and 
seeking had been for me in vain. What good 
had it been to others after me ? I opened the 
volume again and read. I was fascinated, 
lured to my punishment. Nemesis stood over 
me and directed me with fatal success. I 
found everything. With the aid of the records 
and my recollections, I recovered the whole 
dreadful past. I found the names of old 
solicitors and guardians of family documents, 
letters and memoranda; cuttings from news- 
papers, notices of deaths and marriages, suits 
at law, public and private scandals and mis- 
fortunes, even parts of my own library and 
correspondence. Together they told the start- 
ling story of the consequences of my deeds. 
I read the records of my life from beyond the 
grave. 

This, briefly, is what I learned : 

My " dear wife " soon after my death, had 



EAItTn ItEVIKITED. 163 

maiTied again. She wedded, this time, an old 
lover of hers, an indolent artist, who fanned 
her social aiuMtion, squandered my hard- 
earned money, led her into all manner of fool- 
ish extravagance, and finally cansed her death. 
He quarreled with my son and daughter, drove 
them from their home, and broke up the family. 
And my darling daughter ! — I could not read 
her story without tears. She had for a brief 
season sported in tlie sunshine of society ; then 
she had fallen in love witli a promising young 
business man of the vicinity, and was engaged 
to he married, Througli the extravagance of 
her step-father and mother, and her brother's 
mismanagement, she lost her fortune. When 
hsvjimic^ learned of it, he broke the engage- 
ment, and broke her heart. She slowly faded 
and died — an unfruited flower, frozen in the 
bud — and passed quietly away like her lovely 
namesake, my lost Theresa. 

With what burning shame did I read the 
record of my sun's Ufe! — shame, not fur his 
misdoings, but for his father's. He had stai-ted 
out with fair prospects in life, determined to 
follow ill his father's footsteps and increase liis 
inheritance. But, with the over-confidence of 
youth, in hia hiiste to be suddenly rich, he fell 
into a snare. By bad speculations and the 
treachery of a trusted partner in an attempt 
to " corner the market," he lost everything. 
When he found himself reduced to his ov.u 



1 64 EAR TH REVISITED. 

resources, he discovered that he 'was badly 
equipped for the battle of life. He cursed his 
father for giving him no useful education or 
handicraft. He attempted speculation, but 
sank lower and lower, until he envied the inde- 
pendent mechanic going to his well-paid labor, 
and even the mail-carriers who in their daily 
rounds performed a useful service and received 
a certain recompense. At last,with manly de- 
termination, he set to work at the bottom round, 
to climb the ladder and learn a business. He 
was fortunately young and unmarried. By 
perseverance and application, he succeeded. 
Then he could proudly say in answer to the 
question, " What can you do ? " "I can do 
something." 

He acquired a good business position and 
married. He lived long and prosperously. 
He had an only daughter, the delight of his 
heart. She grew up and loved, " not wisely 
but too well." She was betrayed and deserted 
by the young man to whom she was engaged 
to be married. It created a great scandal at 
the time. My son, a man of great pride, was 
crushed, but determined to have satisfaction 
for his lost honor. He demanded it from the 
young man's father. 

He had come from the part of the country 
in which I had lived. He taunted my son by 
returning the reproaches which he heaped upon 
the destroyer of his daughter. Letters passed 



EARTH BEVISITED. 165 

between them. In one, the youth's father 
wrote to my son : " Drop the matter. Your 
father deceived my mother. My son has be- 
trayed your daughter. We are even." Father 
and daughter soon after died. My family was 
extinct. 

I returned to Brooklyn as in a dream. I 
knew not where else to go. I felt ashamed 
to look my fellow-men in the face. I thought 
all must read in my countenance the story of 
my return to retribution. Yet no vengeful 
fate had followed me ; no supreme Justice had 
meted out my punishment. The inevitable 
consequences of wrong-doing had fallen upon 
my descendants, " Visiting the sins of the 
fathers upon the children." 

How could I meet Helen Newcome and look 
in her pure eyes again ? I recalled our con- 
versation of the morning, her sad premonitions, 
and our happy walk in the park, now seemingly 
ages past in Paradise Lost. 

" Paradise, so late their happy seat, 
Waved over by that flaming brand ; the gate 
With dreadful faces thronged and tiery arms." 

Yet Helen could know nothing of my sins, 
and would not believe me if I should confess 
them. She had indeed begun to believe that 
I was forgetting my delusions, while she strove 
still more with the blandishments of love to 
win me from them. 



166 EARTH REVISITJED. 

Now, I knew she could never succeed. Mj 
impressions were confirmed beyond possibiKty 
of contradiction. 

Yet, why should I burden her young life 
and sadden her heart by insistence upon them ? 
The past could not be retrieved. Why should 
not I too strive to forget it ? I resolved to say 
nothing of my experience to Helen, and to en- 
deavor to be the same to her, though I felt my 
utter unworthiness of her and that I could 
never meet her again with the sincerity and 
love I had formerly felt. The shadow of a 
shameful secret must ever hang between us. * 

Yet, in my researches, I had made one un- 
expected and pleasiiig discovery. I found the 
will of a man of wealth, leaving a bequest to 
my family as a memorial of gratitude for a 
kindness done him long before by me, though 
it had entirely escaped from my recollection. 
In reading his will and recital of the benefit, 
however, I recalled the circumstance. It seems 
that one evening as I was hastening from my 
store to my home, I met on one of the cross 
streets leading to the river, a poor young man, 
who accosted me for aid. I rarely paid any 
attention to such request. &gt;, but a glance at the 
poor boy's face, showed that he was no tramp. 
He was fresh from the country. His look was 
so drawn with suffering and tense with despair, 
that it aroused my interest. I hurriedly gave 
him some money. I did not stop to listen to 



EARTH BEYISITED. 167 

ills sad story, or his words of gratitude, but 
told him to call at my store in the morning. 
He did so, and as I was in need of a porter, I 
gave hlra employment. He was most faithful 
and industrious, but I paid no further attention 
to him, and after a time lost sight of him. But 
he rose in life from that day, and at length 
became a man of wealth and influeuce. He 
said in his will that 1 had sMved his life and 
made him all he was. When I first met him, 
he was on his way to the river, determuied to 
leap from the dock in his utter despair at the 
heartlessness and indifference of the great city. 
Hij appeal to me was his last hope. I had 
saved hiui; but as I had never inquired into 
his circumstances, he had hesitated to confide 
them to me, and when, in after years, he became 
rich, he was too proud to do so, not knowing 
how I would receive his confession. Thus I 
had died without the knowledge of my good 
deed, and he revealed it only on his death-bed, 
to which men too often defer the righting of 
the wrongs and performance of the ihities of 
life. The deed of kindness 1 had done had 
been unintentional and unknown, yet it was 
none the less an act of unending beneficence 
and blessing. 

It was late wlien I reached Helen's home. 
She had retired and 1 did not see her until the 
next morning. 



168 EARTH ME VISITED. 



^ jf 



xn. 

When I met Helen next morning, she came 
to me with a quick, glad movement, gave me 
her morning kiss and earnestly asked : 

"Where were you yesterday? You were 
not with father. Are you able to go about 
again alone ? I am thankful if it is so, yet I 
was anxious about you yesterday. I felt an 
intuition that you were in danger, that some 

evil was impending over you, that you " 

suddenly she ceased speaking. An indefinable 
expression of fear and repugnance flashed 
across her fair face. Her dark eyes seemed to 
burn through my inmost being and read all its 
guilty secrets. She dropped my hand and 
stepped back as from the touch of shame, still 
piercing me with those awful eyes of innocence 
and truth. 

" Harold, what is it ? What have you 
done ? " she whispered. " You are changed, 
you are not my true, faithful lover as before." 

" I have been to New York, but I cannot 
tell you what I have found," I strove to answer, 
whUe my heart sank within me. " Can you 
not beUeve me, trust me, love me, as before ? " 
I implored. " You may understand me better 
some time." 



EARTH REVISITED. 169 

*' I know you perfectly uow," she an- 
swered. " I believe you, trust you, aad love 
you; but you do uot kuuw yourself. Some 



Oil Harold, why has 
she sobbed, burying 



evil has come upon yo: 
all this befallen us ! " 
her face on my arm. 

" I do not know, I cannot tell. The mys- 
teries of life are more than I can fathom," I 
murmured. " Would that I knew myself; 
whence I came and whither bound. But the 
narrow circle of our lives is rimmed by mys- 
tery and unfathomable oblinon. Who can 
pierce it ? " 

" I, too, have met a mystery," responded 
Helen, looking up and vainly striving to 
resume her former confidence. " Look at thia 
paper. 1 found it upon ray table this morn- 
ing, though I am sure it was not there when 
I retired. Whose writing can this be ? What 
does it mean? " 

Absently T took the small, faded sheet from 
her band, and gknced at the writing. It was 
BOmewhat indistinct, but I clearly read the 
words, " Somewhere, somehow, we shall meet 
again." Instantly, as by a lightning's flash, 
those words burned before my eyes and I was 
transported into the past. I was again young, 
and held in my hand Theresa's last letter. 
These were her last words to me. This was 
her very handwriting! With these words 
came before me in an instant, as with the 



170 EARTH REVISITED, 

dying, all the incidents and feelings of my 
past life. Love rose from the grave and stood 
before me. All the old affection flowed into 
my heart. My love for Theresa revived and 
possessed me perfectly. My new life and love 
were swallowed up in the old. " Theresa," I 
sighed, " my long-lost love ! " 

" You seem to be absorbed in that piece of 
paper ; perhaps you can explain its presence. 
And who, pray, may be your lost love? " 

Clearly the words fell upon my ear, but I 
scarcely heard them. I had forgotten Helen's 
presence. I raised my eyes to her. Tall and 
stately she stood before me as an offended 
goddess. The majesty of love disdained was 
in her attitude, while the fire that shone in the 
deep orbs of her eyes threatened to consume 
me. But now I was not awed or melted. I 
looked at her with unconscious admiration of 
her beauty and splendor ; but without love and 
without relenting. 

"You are magnificent in your anger, Helen," 
I responded. " But why should you be angry? 
These strange words did but remind me of the 
love of my former life, my lost Theresa. " 

" Must I forever hear that name ? " she ex- 
claimed with fine indignation, which yet fell 
upon me unheeded. " Are you bewitched ? 
WUl you never cease to dream dreams and 
follow pjiantoms? I will have no divided 
affection. I will share your heart with no 



EARTU REVISITED. 171 

rival, be she living or dead. Unless you can 
g^ve me your whole heart you are not mine. 
Until then, leave me. Let me not see you 
until you come drawn by the iiieaistible power 
of love. Good-bye, Harold," 

She stretched out her hand to me and strove 
to hide the rising softness in her gleaming 
eyes. 

" Helen, do not leave me thus," I whispered, 
striving to detain her. ■ " Do you not love me ? " 

" Love you ! " she turned almost fiercely 
upon me, " Yes, Harold, I love you with all my 
heart; with a perfect and uncluingeable affec- 
tion. Heuce 1 will have a pui-e affection in 
return. But you do not love me. It is better 
that we part. If you cau be happy without me 
your love is not perfect." She clasped her 
hands to her breast as if to repress the rising 
Bobs, and swiftly vanished from the room, her 
very movement betokening the goddess. 

I was left standing alone, scarcely realizing 
what had occurred. Helen had left me ; but I 
was more confounded by her last acts and 
wotds, than by that fact. Hers was the very 
act of Theresa when I left her. She had sank 
upon the sofa, clasping her hands to her bosom, 
saying, '* I am weeping here." Tlie very 
words Helen had jnat nttei-ed, were those 
Theresa had^vritten me, during our long separa- 
tion.' "If you cau be happy without me your 
love is not perfect." 



172 EARTH REVISITED. 

But I could not fathom the mystery. I was 
absorbed in my present situation. Helen had 
bade me leave her, and I was obliged to seek 
a new home. But whither could I go ? I was 
a stranger in my own land, an untimely visitant 
to the world. What could 1 do without Helen ? 
Yet I could not follow her ; I could not see her 
again until she should send for me. 

I turned away, while her last words lingered 
in my ears with a tender, cadence that thrilled 
my soul. What depth of love they sounded, 
I did not then know. My acquaintance with 
her had been brief, while the love of a lifetime 
was in my heart. 

At length I sought and found a new resi- 
dence in the family of a widow. She had 
recently lost her husband in the prime of his 
life, who left her an inheritance of seven chil- 
dren, an unfinished manuscript, and many un- 
completed discoveries and experiments. He 
had been a physician and scientist, and had lost 
his health and life through his too ardent devo- 
tion to his researches, and his efforts to discover 
the elixir of life. He had not succeeded in his 
experiments, but he had left behind him, in his 
sturdy offspring, the renewal of life. The 
widow Merivale was a buxom blonde of about 
thirty-five, devoted to the memory of her hus- 
band, and the rearing of her children. Their 
modest dwelling was secured to them through 
the Mutual Home Saving Association, of which

her huabaiid had been a member, and the sup- 
port of her family was assured through the 
Widows' and Orpiians' Benefit Fund, estab- 
lished and sustained by the city fiom the taxes 
on the sale of wiiiesj tobacco, and on placea of 
aniiisement. Besides, tlie WidtJwa' Committee 
of the People's Chmx-h consulted and advised 
with her, as to the care and training of her chil- 
dren, andby their sympathy and systematic as- 
fflstance took the place, as far as possible, of the 
departed. They seemed to be persuaded that 
"pure religion and undefiled ' in the words of 
a certain writer m the New Testament, called 
Jumes, the brother of Jesus, " is to visit the 
widows and fatherless in their affliction." But 
now, instead of its being left to the spontane- 
ous impulses of huniati sympathy, or to so- 
called Chiistian ehai-ity, the care of the be- 
reaved and uiifortunate was made the business 
of the community. 

The widow's family ranged from the baby, 
Howai'd. which had never seen its father, to 
a beautiful daughter of seventeen, Irene, the 
eldest. She was a perfect blonde, with short, 
golden hair, curling about a low brow of snowy 
white and a slender neck of swau-Uke grace. 
She was as bright and volatile aa a sunbeam, 
and her rippling laughter bubbled through the 
house continually likea brook. But in her large, 
deep blue eyes, were depths of soul unsounded 
yet, and often in moments of rejiose, a strange 



174 EARTH REVISITED. 

weird light shone in them which seemed 
strangely at variance with her usual evanes- 
cence. 

The mother lived only in the memory of the 
past, and in constant reference to her dead 
husband's tastes and wishes. 

" What would Harlowe say to that ? I 
think Harlowe would have done so/' were 
expressions constantly on her lips and in her 
thoughts. And often when alone, she would 
attire herself as he used to desire, and sit as if 
expecting him and ready to greet him. She 
often would speak of his coming, as if she 
expected his return at any moment, and had 
been known to go to the station to meet him as 
if on his return from a journey. 

One of her boys was of a histrionic tempera- 
ment and delighted in learning and repeat- 
ing passages from the tragic poets. On the 
first morning after I had taken up my abode 
in the widow's family, I was awakened by 
hearing the boy Martin repeating under my 
window in sepulchral tones, " I am thy father's 
ghost." 

One of my rooms was that formerly occupied 
by Dr. Merivale as a laboratory and physician's 
office. In it still remained some of his instru- 
ments, and upon the shelves of his cabinet the 
bones and skulls of dissected men and animals. 
Among them I discovered one day a very 
peculiar collection of what at first appeared to 



EARTU HEVISITED. 



175 



be petrified bones, but they proved to be a 
mai'velous collection of musical stones. Each, 
when struck; gave forth a clear, ringing, musi- 
cal note. They were plainly natural objects, 
and the tone and pitch were inherent in them. 
It could not be given to them or changed. 
Yet strange as it seemed, each gave a definite 
note of the musical seale, so that when placed 
side by side, they constituted an octave, and 
could he played upon in the manner of a dul- 
cimer or xylophone. Biit one, the fifth in the 
octave, was wanting. Upon inquiry, Mrs. 
Meiivale informed me tliat the collecting of 
these stones had been her husband's cherished 
hobby and had occupied many years. He had 
found one on the summit of the Rocky Moun- 
tains, another in a mine in Peru, another in 
the valley of tlie Rhone in France, another 
in India, and a fifth in Abyssinia, yet when 
brought together they had constituted a per- 
fect musical instrument. The finding of the 
fifth had been an almost hopeless task. AH 
the othere in the octave were found long be- 
fore, and when it was at last discovered, and 
found to be in perfect tune, it seemed almost 
a miracle. The Doftor was happy in the pos- 
session of his unique instrnment ; but a short 
time previous to his death the fifth in the scale 
had been lost. Its removal was a great mys- 
tery to all. It had been kept in a case with 
the others in the doctor's room, to which no one 



176 EARTH BEVISITED. 

else had access. Its loss was a ceaseless source 
of regret and grief to the Doctor and his 
family. It had been his chief delight in his 
failing health to sit and play in soft, sweet 
tones upon the musical stones. Their sound, 
most weird and strange, had a very soothing 
influence upon his mind, and the breaking of 
the chord had doubtless hastened his demise. 
Since his death, no one had disturbed them, and 
they had remained in his room as he left them. 

" I could not touch them," said Mrs. Meri- 
vale, with tears. " Harlowe's very presence 
seems to linger about them. Sometimes at 
night I hear him again playing upon them, and 
the strange sweet music comes stealing upon 
me like a refrain from the spirit land." I did 
not accept the widow's explanation of the music, 
but I deeply sympathized with her feelings. 

I soon came to feel quite at home in my new 
dwelling, and to find diversion in the society 
of the widow and her children. 

Here came to me the experience of my life. I 
had brought with me from New York, when I 
made my discoveries, a package of old letters 
which I had found tied up and packed in a 
case with old deeds, wills and memoranda in 
charge of the family solicitor, but now of no 
value. The package was marked, " Harold 
Atherton,^' but what were its contents I did 
not then know. 

Soon after I was settled in my new home, I 



mahtii UKVitiriEU. 177 

took occasion to examiue it. With trembling 
hand I untied the faded pbik tape with which 
an old kwyer had bound it, and there, spread 
out before my wondering gaze, were Theresa's 
letters to nie. For nearly six years we had 
corresponded, from a few months after our 
engagement until within a few weeks of her 
death ; and here before me now were her 
deathless words of love, as fiesh and true as 
when first penned. 

I had pioHsly preserved them all my life, 
and now I held them in my hands again, each 
in its envelope with its date, those of each 
year carefully bound together and marked, 
precisely as I had left them in my private safe, 
more than a century before. I had never read 
them all in order since receiving them. It 
seemed like removing the coffin lid of long 
buried love; but no death was there, no decay. 
It was undying love, immortal youth. As I 
read those words of sweet affection and tender 
Interest, of youthful hope and confidence, 
mingled with angelic faith and patience in suf- 
fering and sorrow, the bUnding knowledge 
came over me, that I loved her and that she 
was lost to i»e forever. My heart was in the 
irrecoverable past. Helen Newt-onie and all 
my new life were blotted out in tlie flood of 
memories and undying love which rushed over 
me as I read. Theresa's words of affection, and 
of gentle humor, of sadness at our separation, 



178 EARTH liEVISITEB. 

of longing for the coming of our union, of grief 
at my words of misapprehension, of patience 
and sublime trust in God, were as fresh and 
touching as when first written. I read again 
the first letter of the happy maiden to her 
ardent lover after their separation. Ah ! little 
did those young hearts realize that it was to be 
for life. But failing health had been her fate. 
Shut in from the activities of existence, with a 
longing for a life of usefulness, she could, as 
she said, but " sit in her room and see the 
world go by." 

I read the whole story, through years of joy 
and sorrow, down to the day of our last meet- 
ing. Hearing that I was near, she had sent 
for me.- She received me fondly, as before. 
Not a word of reproach did she utter, but un- 
complainingly assumed that I loved her no more. 
Yet she made no concealment of her affection 
for me, but in seeming forgetfulness of the 
past, went back to the days of our early love, 
striving to be happy once more in their memory. 
My heart again grew warm toward her and I 
left her with a sweet kiss, as of old, little think- 
ing it was the last on earth. Not long after, 
came the announcement of her death. A letter 
from her sister told how peacefully and sweetly 
she sank away with my name upon her lips in 
the very room where we had spent so many 
happy hours, and at the very hour of a Sabbath 
evening when we had often been together. 



EARTH IlEriSITED. 179 

All this and much more, I read that aftei^ 
noon, words and coufideaces too sacred to he 
repeated. Her very heart and soul had been 
made known to me : a heart of such virgin 
truth and purity, of such love for man and 
faith in God, as only the augels are permitted 
to look upon. Her patience in auffeiing, her 
courage in separation and trial, her entu-e un- 
selfiahness and her trust in God were nothing 
less than angelic. I read in an early letter; 

" My dear Harold : — 

" You know, dearest, this is your day. I have 
been out several times to look at the sky, and 
cannot discern a eloud. May God grant that 
your life may be as cloudless, as pleasant, as 
this beautiful day. I know it is foolish, but I 
cannot help having faith in such things, and 
the clouds yesterday made me feel sad ; but to- 
day I feel veiy happy. I am willing to have 
my life clouded, if yours may always be bright. 

" 7 P. M. You are never for a moment absent 
from my thoughts. I am sorry to note such a 
change hi the weather ; it is not unpleasant, 
only cold. 

'* May God bless you, my dearest, and pre- 
serve you," 

"Dear Harold : — We are having a very 
lonely, rainy evening, and I will try to make it 
brief hy writing to you. 



180 EARTH REVISITED. 

" At this season I can but recall those beauti- 
ful verses of Bryant's : 

'The luelanclioly days have come, the saddest of 
the year, 
Of wailhig winds and naked woods, and meadows 
brown and sear ; ' 

they are so true, so pathetic. They have a 
peculiar charm for me. This often seems to 
me a cold world, but the thoughts of your love 
serve to make it bright. I wish that I could 
be with you, but it doesn't seem that it is so 
decreed. Some day, dearest, perhaps, when 
we are united, we shall forget this separation. 
I while away many a weary hour of late, build- 
ing ' air castles,' dreaming of the future, the 
bright, happy future. God grant it may be 
bright ! Good-night, my dearest." 

And in her last she wrote : 

" I have such a desire this morning to see 
you and talk with you ! I am often with you 
' in spirit.' I cannot endure the thought of 
never seeing you again. Somewhere^ some- 
how^ meet we must. God bless and preserve 
you, dear Harold." 

I bowed my head upon Theresa's letters and 
hot tears came to my eyes, as I recalled the 
tragic story of her love and sorrow, and real- 
ized that she was gone from me forever ; be- 
bond reach of my regrets and penitence. My 
heart melted within me as the consciousness 



EAliTU REVISITED. 



181 



I possessed me that I loved her still, had always 
1 loved her, and should never cease to love her. 
I Time was not. My heart was as young as in 
I the days " when we were first acquaint," as 
I she expressed it, and she, removed from earth, 
was ever young, ever bright and fair, A 
deep, unutterable longing came over me to see 
her and assure her of my love and penitence. 
A mad rebellion rose within me against the in- 
exorable bar of death whicih separated us. 

" She is not dead," I cried. " Such love 
cannot die. In some other world, if not in this, 
she lives and walks in peace. And if she lives 
she loves me still. In her last letter she ex- 
pressed her strong desire to see me, and she 
died breathing my name. K aught survives 
the tomb, Theresa lives. If there be a heaven 
above, she awaits me tlieie. ' Somewhere, sonie- 
I how, meet we must ; ' hut where is she now ? " 
As I called upon my lost one, I felt that 
I the only real thing in the world is love. All 
I else is a phantasmagoria, a passing show. All 
' the activities of my jiajst life and of the new 
world about me were as an idle dream. Theresa 
and her love, were all that existed. All life 
held nothing else ; every other creature had 
faded away. For me they did not exist. But 
where was she? Her form had disappeared 
I from earth ; yet I felt that her soul could not 
I die. The quahties of mind and heart embodied 
I in her could not perish. Such love as ours 



182 EARTH REVISITED. 

could not be for only a few brief years of 
mingled joy and sorrow. 

I recalled Mrs. Merivale and her bereave- 
ment. I could not contain my anguish, and 
sought sympathy from her. I remembered 
how Theresa had often sighed for a sympa- 
thetic soul in which to confide her love and 
sorrow ; but she had always felt it too sacred 
to disclose and had bravely suffered in silence. 
No one had known our story but ourselves ; but 
now in this new world, I felt that I could par- 
tially reveal my grief. Besides, I had never 
before felt it so poignantly as now, when the 
habiliments of my past were removed. As im- 
pressions on the mind can never be forgotten, 
so with those made on the heart. The love of 
my youth had never been effaced ; it had been 
only concealed by the vain passions and ex- 
periences which had occupied my life; now 
that they were removed, the early palimpsest 
shone forth in all its original perfection. The 
engraving on my heart was the image of 
Theresa. 

"Dear Mrs. Merivale," I abruptly exclaimed, 
^^ was ever true love happy ? Did ever any one 
possess the loved being, the only passion of life. 
And were they happy ? It is too great a bliss 
to be found on earth. Who having it could 
wish for other earthly good or even for heaven." 

The astonished woman looked at me for a 
moment in wonder, then suddenly seated her- 



EAiiTU REVISITED, 183 

self without a word and burst into a passion of 
uncontrolable weeping. I could only look on 
in helpless bewilderment, realizing how I had 
unwittingly opened the fountain of her grief. 

" Yes, yes ! " at length she sobbed. " I 
loved Harlowe with all my heart. I never 
thought of any other. No cloud ever came 
between us, until the day of his death. I lived 
only for him ! " 

" Yes, I know," I interrupted, " but he died. 
He has gone from you, as my love from me, 
and you will never see him more." 

" Do not say that," she exclaimed. " It is 
not true, I shall see him. I do see him daily. 
Every night I converse with him in my dreams. 
Every hour I feel his spirit near me. I live in 
constant assurance of his presence. I often 
feel the touch of his vanished hand." 

" But how do you know it ? You cannot 
see him," I said. 

" We have more senses than five," she an- 
swered. " When the fleshly perceptions are 
bound in sleep, the free spirit can behold things 
unseen by day. Yet it is only a few years and 
I shall see him face to face. I shall put off 
my earthly garments and be with him to part 
no more." 

" But how ? Where ? " I asked. 

" In heaven, in the spirit world. That is the 
only real existence. This life is but a dreary 
waste that stretches on before the spirit's 



184 EARTH REVISITED, 

home." Her voice fell as she gazed before 
her into space and a beautiful brightness filled 
her face, as she softly whispered, " Yes, Har- 
lowe, I shall come soon." 

I returned to my room, awed, but unsatis- 
fied. I could but still ask, " Where is my lost 
love?" But no answer came to my voice; no 
vision to my longing eyes. 

" If there be a life hereafter, will she know 
me? If identity be lost, she is worse than 
dead. Heaven without memory is a mockery." 

I could not harbor that thought. Far better 
the faith of Mrs. Merivale. But that I could 
not accept. I looked up to the stars and be- 
held the vast, Jnmeasureable spaces and the 
silent orbs rolling in solitary grandeur, some 
filled with life and love and hope, some blazing 
suns of inextinguishable fire, others cold, dead 
worlds, whose history was written ages since, 
and which yet roll on in unburied death. 
"Where 'is heaven?" I cried. "Where the 
spiiits' home?" But only the night wind 
sighed and the twmkling stars answered not. 
I beheld Arcturus, " a gigantic sphere, half a 
million times greater than the sun, rushing 
down upon us at the rate of fifty miles a second, 
sweeping from his celestial course the stellar 
worlds which, swerved from their appointed 
course at his approach, plunge into his fiery 
bosom and are swallowed up as a pebble in the 



ocean." 



EARTH REVISITED, 185 

"Yet she is alive!" I sighed in dumb defi- 
ance. "Love cannot die. *' Somewhere, some- 
how, meet we must.' If the missing note of the 
musical stones could be found, why not the lost 
chord of my soul ? " 

I re-entered my room, but not to rest. I re- 
tired late, with faint hopes of another, clearer 
vision of my love ; but it came not. In the 
early morning, just before dawn, I fell asleep ; 
soon after, I was aw^akened by a strange, sweet 
sound. It was soft and musical, and seemed to 
proceed from my adjoining room. 

I arose and listened. At length I perceived 
that it was the weird cadence of the musical 
stones — and, what surprised me most — the hai^ 
mony was complete. The lost fifth sounded in 
perfect unison with the others. I was not 
greatly surprised at first to hear the sound. 
I was absorbed in listening to tlie strange, 
unearthly music, unlike anything I had ever 
heard, rising and dying like the tones of an 
seolian harp. But who could be the unknown 
musician ? 

Determined to discover the source of the 
sounds, I arose and opened the door. The 
music ceased ; but in the dim light I beheld a 
slight figure in white, slowly moving across the 
room, toward me. 

As she approached, I perceived, in the gray 
light, the golden locks and graceful form of 
Irene Merivale. Her deep blue eyes were wide 



186 EARTH REVISITED. 

open, but she saw me not. In her hand she 
held a small object that I could not distinguish 
in the darkness. She passed me with a swift, 
silent movement, opened a door upon the op- 
posite side and disappeared. I stood a moment 
in amazement gazing after her, then returned 
to my room ; but not to sleep. The mystery 
of the musical stones was solved. The lost 
fifth was found. I could not divine by what 
means it had been discovered, but I had lieard 
its sweet note united in harmony with its fel- 
lows. Thus, thought I, may the lost half of 
my heart be found. As all things in the uni- 
verse attract each other, so must immortal love 
find its affinity at last. Thus I sat musing 
until morning. 

Not long after daylight, I heard Martin 
Merivale reciting beneath my window, " The 
woman-soul leadeth us upward and on." I 
arose, hastened to the other room and unlocked 
the cabinet. The musical stones were undis- 
turbed, and the lost fifth was not with them. 

Next morning at the table as I greeted Irene, 
I noticed a faint flush upon her cheek ; but 
although I watched her closely, I could not per- 
ceive the slightest reference to her musical per- 
formance. She was as bright and sparkling, 
blithe and gay as a bird flitting from flower to 
flower. Her mother seemed somewhat more 
restrained and calm than usual, as if she had 
heard again her husband's precious instrument. 



EARTH REVISITED. 187 

She cast upon me a sad, sympathetic look, as if 
to encourage me with the assurance that she 
had again received communication from the de- 
parted ; but I had no such cause for comfort. 
I knew the source of the mysterious music ; 
yet I could not more clearly account for it. I 
knew that Irene was the unconscious agent, yet 
I was equally at a loss to explain her ability to 
produce such entrancing tones from the sound- 
ing stones, and to account for the presence of 
the lost fifth. Still I took hope from the event, 
trusting that in some unexplained manner I 
might be enlightened as to the mysteries about 
me. 

Irene interested me greatly. In addition to 
her personal charms of youth and beauty, she 
possessed a mind singularly free from the in- 
fluences of convention and education. She had 
been allowed to grow up in a perfectly spon- 
taneous manner, and to follow the natural trend 
of her tastes. In consequence, her judgments 
and opinions upon men and things were strik- 
ingly fresh and unconventional. They were to 
me a constant source of interest and delight. 
I called her my pretty heathen ; for in matters 
of religion, she was as untaught as an Indian 
maiden, while her heart was as pure and trans- 
parent as the mountain spring, and its gushings 
as fresh and stimulating. Yet unknown to her- 
self, she was possessed by a hidden power that 
revealed itself in moments of unconsciousness. 



188 EARTH REVISITED, 

The knowledge of this fact made her doubly 
interesting to me. She seemed to take much 
pleasure in my society ; but my heart was bur- 
dened with its own grief and could find relief 
only in occupation. I turned again to Mr. 
Newcome, and sought some explanation of the 
mysteries that surrounded me. 

But as I thought of Helen, it seemed ages 
since we had parted. Old love had revived and 
completely banished the new. It seemed to be 
the only passion I had ever known, and Helen 
a passing stranger. Hopeless as my love 
appeared to be, I could but cling to it as the 
only thing of worth and reality that I now pos- 
sessed. It alone had survived the tomb. 

When I reached Helen's home, a letter was 
put into my hand. Eagerly I opened it and 
read : — 

" Dear Harold : — 

" I have placed the sea between us. Do not 
seek to follow me 5 I cannot see you and know 
you do not love me. I know not if we shall 
meet again, though I know not how to live 
without you. Good-bye, Helen." 

I was completely bewildered. I could not 
follow the mysterious movements of the female 
heart, which, true as the needle to the pole, 
yet upon the slightest occasion is thrown into 
the strangest perturbations. 



EARTH REVISITED, 189 

I hastened to Mr. Newcome. 

" Where is Helen ?" I asked. 

" She has gone to Europe for a few days," 
he replied without surprise. 

" To Europe ! " I repeated. " How long 
does it take to make the voyage ? " 

" Ten to twelve hours by anemon/' was the 
answer. " But you seem surprised ? Do not 
be anxious about Helen. She has appeared 
somewhat sad of late, and the change will doubt- 
less be a benefit to her. Cheer up, my boy. 
Do not look so downcast ; a little separation is 
sometimes good for lovers. What can I do to 
interest you ? " 

While Mr. Newcome had been speaking, my 
mind had rapidly run over the course of my 
acquaintance with Helen, as far as I could re- 
member it. Our love, our happiness, our sor- 
row and our separation ; all was a mystery to 
me. I hardly seemed to be an active agent, 
but to be borne along upon a tide, powerless to 
direct my course. I was completely at a loss 
to understand this last step of Helen's. I could 
only abandon the attempt to find a solution and 
wait with such patience as I could command, 
the developments of the future.

In my visits to Mr. Newcomers dwelling 1 
had hitherto been so greatly interested in its 
occupants and in their disclosures of the social 
revolution in the world during the past cen- 
tury, that I had not been very observant of 
many of the objects about me. I had seen 
many strange instruments without understand- 
ing their uses or having opportunity to inquire 
in regard to them. In Mr. Newcome's labora- 
tory I had perceived the chemical apparatus 
employed by him in his investigations in food 
products, among which was a sort of Aladdin's 
lamp, by which a good lunch could be prepared, 
including food and fuel, at a cost of less than 
two cents. Such miracles as this went far 
to explain the wonderful fact that no one 
in this age could want for the neces- 
saries of life. I could easily comprehend how, 
with such inventions, this could be the 
case, when the personal element was also fully 
trained to habits of industry and economy, 
guided by intelligence and assisted by the spirit 
of mutual helpfulness.

I had also heard the dulcet tones of Helen's 
- strange piano which seemed to give forth music 
not only from itself, but to set up responding 
centers of haraiouy all about it. Thus, also, 
invisible orchestras had surrounded us with soft 
melody in the People's Palace, and floods of 
light had seemed to illuminate the whole build- 
ing from an unknown source ; not like the bright 
pomts of the electric are, hutwithan all-pervad- 
ing radiance like that of the sun ; while the 
automatic telegraph transmitting man's thought 
around the world at the rate of a thousand 
words a minute, filled me with woudernieiit 
and awe. I had, iu my former life, been greatly 
uitereated in the staitliug inventions made in 
the mechanical, chemical, and electrical arts, 
but they had crowded upon each other witli 
such bewildering rapidity and advancement as 
to make it impossible to follow them. The 
mind had become so paralyzed that men ceased 
to be surprised at anything, and failed to 
appreciate the gigantic strides already made. 
It was characterized as the age of machinery. 
But while met;hanism had extended mjui's 
power to tlie length of Archimedes' lever, so 
that he could move the world, it had produced 
too great a reliance upon macliinery and meth- 
ods in social, political and religious movements. 
Men looked to organizations and governments 
to remove all the evil that flesh is heir to, 
forgetting that no more power can be got

out of a machine than is put into it, and that 
no combinations of men can possess greater 
virtue than that of the individuals composing 
them. 

During my last conversation with Mr. New- 
come, I had observed through a half-opened 
door, a number of strange instruments, some- 
what similar to telephones or telegraph ma- 
chines, from which proceeded a succession of 
singing sounds and broken notes, different 
from anything I had ever heard. At the first 
opportunity, therefore, I interrogated my in- 
structor as to their source. 

" It is the harmonic telegraph," he re- 
sponded. 

"' Do you send messages by music, and talk 
in tone ?" 

'^ Precisely so,'" he went on. " I have been 
much interested in some recent improvements 
in the art, and have set up an experimental 
apparatus m my laboratory. But if you would 
like to see the system in operation, I will take 
you to the central telegraph station or post- 
office where letters are dispatched by wire more 
quickly than a ten-word telegram and at less 
cost than letter postage." 

I gladly accepted the invitation, and as we 
proceeded down the pleasant streets, Mr. 
Newcome continued : 

" The communication of thought by visible 
sig^s, is undoubtededly the greatest achieve- 



EAHTll REVISITED. 193 

ment of the human mind. But, from the time 
of the Egyptians, no improvement in the 
mechanical means of writing liad been made 
until the invention of the tyj^ewriter. That 
extended man's fingers tenfold, doubled hia 
wipocity and trebled his time, while lie econo- 
mized the most valuable of all labor, that of 
the brain-worker. The author is no longer 
chained to his desk, while the filuggish pen 
clogs the free flow of his thoughts, but his 
fingers find wuigs on which to fly with the 
speed of thought." 

'' That was one of the inventions of my day," 
I remarked with pride. " I had one in my 
office. But T often noticed the inrongriiity 
and inconvenience of writing out of sight 
uistead or in the natural manner, and the fre- 
quently zig-zag appearance of the work which 
charaoterized it." 

"Those early machines have long since been 
superseded," continued Mr. Newi-onie, "by 
oJiurs which remedied the defects you mention, 
and added many other valuable improvements. 
A similar history has attended the art of ])rint- 
ing. The earliest printed hooks were as per- 
fect and beautiful specimens of typographic 
art as have since been produced, and though 
the printing-press kept pace with the march of 
improvement, the compositor of the nuieteenth 
eentuiy could do no better or more rapid work 
I than he of the sixteenth. Each separate

piece of metal had to be picked up and placed 
by hand in its proper place and position, and 
again distributed in the same manner. Now 
we have machines on which an unskilled 
operator can play as on a typewriter, and the 
type is set up, justified, cast and composed 
ready for printing with the speed of typewrit- 
ing. But here is our destination." 

As we paused, I perceived a large, handsome 
building known as the Central Post Office and 
Telegraph Station, but I noticed no wires 
carried upon tall poles, no heavy mail-wagons 
nor busthng messengers, for the mails were all 
received and delivered through pneumatic tubes, 
underground, as were also the wires. Ac we 
entered, I perceived a young lady playing upon 
an instrument like a writing machine, which Mr. 
Newcome informed me was an electric type- 
writer or printing telegraph by which the mes- 
sage is printed, at the same time, upon the re- 
cording instrument and upon as many distant 
receiving machines as desired. Thus, a press 
despatch was recorded as fast as written in all 
the newspaper offices of distant cities, and at the 
same time, if desired, set up in type. But I was 
most astonished and interested as we entered 
the room occupied by the harmonic telegraph. 
We were instantly greeted by the music of a 
hundred different instruments, each singing 
to the key of a musical note. Each table was 
occupied by a number of operators, each listen- 



EAIiTII IlEVISTTElJ. 195 

ing to his own little reed, vibrating at a fixed 
rate and singing in his ear its own note of the 
octave, imdJsturlted by the others, and telling 
its own story of the world's doings. But I 
was most astonished when Mr. Newcome in- 
formed' nie that all these notes were produced 

, by electrical pulsation coming over the same 
line wire together ; one series superposed upon 
the other, hut all distributing themselves at the 
receiver to their proper reeds, and reproducing 
the same vibrations and musical notes as the 
reeds from which they had j)roceeded a thou- 
sand milesaway. The electric current bad been 
taught not only to sing and speak, but to print 

I and write with a speed inconceivable for mech- 
anism. An operator, requested me to write a 

I sentence upon a sheet of prepared paper, wliich 
I did, whgn it was inserted into an instrument 

I and written by the electric current a thousand 

I miles distant, and instfintly reproduced upon 
one of the adjoining iuBtrnments in my owji 

' handwriting. I also saw strips and sheets of 
chemically prepared paper flying through 
rapidly revolving cyUndevs under slender steel 
fingers, through which the electric current 
passed, and in its passage marked its message 
upon the paper, in written or printed character, 

[ ottherateof a thousand words a minute. And 
all the while the little reeds sang at their work, 
and music was transcribed into messages of 
love and labor. 



196 EARVa RF. VISITED, 

" What is the function of the little reeds ? " 

I asked. " They look like tuning-forks." 

" That is precisely what they are/' replied 
my friend. " You know each musical note is 
produced by vibrations at a given fixed rate. 
Thus, tuning-forks, made to vibrate at a given 
rate, when struck, always give out the same 
note. It has been found that a current of 
electricity, by being passed through these forks, 
is broken up into wave-like vibrations, and that 

II number of these waves of different lengths 
may be sent together over a single line wire 
and that, at the receiving end, each series of 
waves will go only to the fork whose vibra- 
t -ons are the same as that over which it was 
sent^ which fork in its turn is caused to vibrate 
and repeat the initial tone. Thus the current 
is distributed among several receivers, by which 
means sixteen to twenty messages may be sent 
over one wire at the same time and in opposite 
directions. The same distribution of the cur- 
rent may operate to produce either printing or 
writing, as you have seen, and with inconceiv- 
able rapidity. 

" The chief difficulties in the practical appli- 
cation of the theory have been from induction 
from other wires in proximity and in securing 
synchronism in the apparatus. But these dif- 
ficulties have long since been vanquished. By 
the use of the harmonic system, as is now wel] 
understood, these wonders are accomplished: 



198 EARTH REVISITED. 

" Another difficulty to be overcome has been 
the production of over-tones. A tuning-fork, 
tuned, for instance, at the rate of three hun- 
dred and sixty vibrations a second, will respond 
not only to impulses of that rate, but also of 
any rate which is about an exact divider of the 
former — that is to say, that such fork, the fun- 
damental tone of which is three hundred and 
sixty, will also respond to one hundred and 
eighty, ninety, sixty, or forty-five vibrations, 
and so on. Therefore we are compelled to con- 
fine ourselves to notes included within one oc- 
tave only ; at least the tone of one receiver of 
a set being, for instance, do^, we cannot on the 
same line have a receiver the tone of which 
would be do^ or do^. We can use re^ or re^, if 
for some reason we prefer to take a higher 
tone than re^ 

" The written and printed messages which you 
have seen are first prepared by writing them in 
insulating ink upon conducting material. Thus 
your message was written, and as it passed 
under the wire fingers and through the singing 
reeds it was broken into pulsations which 
reproduced it at the distant receiver. 

^' The invention may be illustrated by a sim- 
ple diagram," concluded Mr. Newcome, as he 
quickly drew an outline sketch of the system. 
^' The operation of the device is as follows : 
The strips S S and S' S' move at approxi- 
mately uniform rate of speed (absolute synchron-

ism not being necessary), which is aeeoniplished 
bj meaus of a weight, clock-woik, or any well- 
known device. Wheu a letter passes under the 
fingers s s,' etc., the contact between the said 
fingers and their contact-points will be inter- 
mittently broken. As these contacts are sever- 
ally broken, the circuits through the corre- 
sponding fingers at the receiving end of the line 
will be closed thiXJUgh the sensitized paper, and 
a discoloration or mark will be produced 
thereon corresponding in length to the length 
of time the said contact at the sending-termlnus 
remains disrupted. In tiiis way it is possible 
to arrange a sufficient number of fingers so that 
a complete letter or character will be repro- 
duced at tlie receiving end of theluie over one 
wire, and with great rapidity." 

While Mr. Newcome had been describing 
the apparatus in hitt usual animated manner, I 
had listened attentively, but unable to follow 
his explanations in detail. I could but catch 
at the mysterious connection between music 
and mathematics, electricity and sound, ethereal 
pulBatioiis and the transmission of tliought. 
There seemed to he a unity and simplicity in 
the universPj Iiitherto un-suspected. 

"•Is this the music of the spheres?'" I 
exclaimed. 

*' Yes, tndy," responded Mr. Newcome seri- 
ously. " Fur you know that sound iind speech, 
light, beat and electricity and all other forms 



200 EARTH REVISITED. 

of force known to us, are but pulsations of the 
all-pervading ether that fills the universe. We 
know that electrical energy can be transmitted 
in waves whose period of vibration is somewhat 
slower than that of heat waves. These waves 
can be caught up and reproduced as the still 
more rapid waves called light. As the electric 
light is but a series of vibrations in a material 
which first produces heat, and then becoming 
more rapid, becomes light, we have at length 
obtained means of producing light without 
heat. A room or a street is filled with arti- 
ficially produced ether-waves just as we fill 
them with the sound from an organ or a band, 
and these etlier waves can be picked up by 
conveniently situated receivers and reproduced 
as light, heat or power, just as one ear or any 
number of ears within range of the sound- 
waves may pick them up and hand them over 
as music." 

" This is certainly a new and wonderful con- 
ception to me," I could but respond. 

Unable to follow him further, my mind leaped 
to a new idea. " Why then, may we not be 
able to communicate our thoughts directly 
through space, by means of the magnetic cur- 
rents or the pulsating ether, instead of being 
bound to a line of wire as the rail-car is to its 
track of steel ? As you have abandoned that 
for the swift air-ship which flies free and far 
through the vast atmosphere, why may not also 



EAnrir revisitjlD. 201 

our thoughts fly from soul to soul through the 
ethereal spaces ? " 

I almost blushed as I spoke, for I felt that I 
had but uttered one of those half-born concep- 
tions which often arise in the mind, in the free 
intercourse of friend with friend, and fall forth 
unfledged. But Mr. Newcome did not disdain 
my idea as I expected. 

" As we are able to produce electricity with- 
out mechanism and thus to light our streets 
and dwelUngs with its all-pervading glow, we 
may be able to telegraph through the air with- 
out visible tracks for the subtle current." 

" But my thought was of the direct impact 
of mind with mind," I interposed. " Call it 
clairvoyance, telepathy or what you will, can- 
not one mind flash its thought directly to 
another, as flag-signals on mountain-tops wave 
from peak to peak over the world below ? It 
seems to me to be no more mysterious than 
what I have this day beheld." 

My friend took my arm and led me away. 

" Indeed, it is not more wonderful," he con- 
tinued as we walked on together. " There are 
no miracles. Nothing can be more mysterious 
than that I can talk to you ; that the vibrations 
of the viewless air made by my lips can con- 
vey my thought to your mind, and that thus 
two souls can converse together in magnetic 
sympathy. Until this is explained we will not say 
that anything is impossible." 



202 EARTH REVISITED. 

As my friend ceased speaking, I could but 
think of his lovely daughter and her strange 
influence on my life, and I felt that though she 
had withdrawn herself in unexplained absence, 
her invisible hand was still leading me in paths 
that I knew not, and her loving thoughts were 
still extended toward me. I returned to my 
room, full of the disclosures of the day in re- 
gard to the Harmonic Telegraph. The strange 
notes of the vibrating reeds still rang in my 
ears and through my mind ran the mysterious 
connection between music and magnetism, 
electricity and thought. The whole universe 
was bound together in bonds of harmony, and all 
things seemed to vibrate in rhythmic numbers. 
Light, heat, sound, life and love itself, were 
but the pulses of the all-pervading spirit of the 
universe. 

" Why may not mortal minds thus commu- 
nicate with each other through this vital fluid? " 
again I asked, as I brooded over my absent love, 
yet ever present to my heart. 

As I sat, sad and solitary, my heart was filled 
with the old love and longing. The new world, 
with its vast achievements and wonderful scenes, 
was untenanted to me. Theresa was all and 
in all. I re-read her letters and reviewed the 
story of our love. The sense of my unworthi- 
ness and selfishness, my sins and shame over- 
whelmed me. Yet I believed that could our 
lives have been ordered differently, could we 



EARTH REVISITED. 203 

have been permitted to enjoy each other's society 
like other lovers, unshadowed by sickness and 
separation, I could in her society have become 
more fit for a life of virtue and happiness. 
Her death, though an irreparable loss to me, 
had preserved her in immortality ; it had 
enshrined her in memory in perpetual youth 
and beauty ; but my loss seemed greater than 
I could bear. 

" Does she yet live ? " I cried. " Her pure 
soul must still dwell in some bright sphere. 
But where is she ? Is she an impalpable spirit, 
or does she walk the solid earth ? " 

Again I reviewed the history of our lives 
and their imperishable influence upon each 
other. Again I reached the bitter end. 
Again I seemed to hold in my hand the fatal 
message which throbbed over the wire that 
never-to-be-forgotten, bleak March morning, 
more than a century before, saying, " Theresa 
is dead." Sadly I sat and gazed into the va- 
cancy of mv room. While thus I sat discon- 
solate, absorbed in my sad memories, I saw be- 
fore me another message, as clear and legible 
as the first. A small square of light appeared 
amid the gloom, and in tlie midst 1 read in glow- 
ing letters, " Theresa lives. You shall see her." 
A roseate brightness seemed to spread from the 
little square, to pervade the room and fill my 
heart. I sprang to my feet to see whence it 
came, when suddenly it vanished and I was 



204 EARTH BE VI SITED. 

alone. I sank into my chair, astounded, but I 
felt that the question of my life was answered. 
Theresa was alive and had sent a thought-mes- 
sage to me. I had now no impatience to behold 
her. I believed that she still lived and loved 
me and had communicated with me. The 
thought that she was indeed among the living 
and that, as she wrote me long before, " Some- 
where, somehow, meet we must, " filled me. with 
peace and calm. After all these years, a few 
days more were nought. I could wait. I 
knew I could do nothing to hasten the glad- 
some hour. 

In the days of our first acquaintance she had 
often set a time when she could see me, which 
seemed to me so unreasonably distant that I 
could scarcely control my impatience ; but now 
I felt that all was well, all for the best, and I 
could patiently await the orderings of the des- 
tiny that led our lives. To her it had been the 
hand of a loving heavenly Father, " Too wise 
to err, too good to be unkind ;" but to me it 
had seemed only an envious fate. Now I re- 
alized as never before, my utter dependence 
upon a Higher Will, and my unworthiness of 
the bUss which had been prepared for me. I 
saw that it was my own hand which had dashed 
the cup from my lips. I feared now to move 
lest I should repeat the fatal error, and I re- 
solved to wait, as patiently as I could, the un- 
foldings of the future. 



EARTH REVISITED, 205 

I retired, with a heart full of hope and peace, 
to dream of my lost one. Again she stood 
beside me, but with brighter looks of love and 
joy than I had beheld before. She beckoned 
to me again to come to her, but I could not 
follow. I sought to rise, but a great weight 
held me down ; I could not move. At length 
the vision vanished and I slept a troubled 
sleep. 

When I arose in the morning, Theresa's let- 
ters were lying upon the table a§ I had left 
them. I gathered them up to replace them in 
their cabinet, when a slip of paper fell from 
them and fluttered to the floor. I picked it up 
and perceived upon it a faint, phosphorescent 
writing. I seized my lens and read in Theresa's 
own hand, as if traced by the electric fluid, 
" Dear Harold, come to me." I stood fixed 
with amazement as I gazed upon the paper in 
my hand, unable to trace its origin or meaning. 

Whence had it come ? I was certain that 
it had not been among my papers previously. 
Theresa had never written me that brief mes- 
sage in our earthly correspondence. I thought 
of the mysteries of the musical telegraph, 
which had been invented in my day. I re- 
called the simultaneous occurrence of thoughts 
and impressions to different minds, many thou- 
sand miles apart. Strange " coincidences " they 
were called, but it seemed to me no more won- 
derful that mind should thus flash its thought 



206 EARTH REVISITED. 

to kindred mind, than that the magnetic cur- 
rent should convey it under the depths of ocean. 
I believed that Theresa indeed was alive and 
had thus made known her existence to me and 
mysteriously impressed her strong desire upon 
the sensitive sheet before me. Beyond this I 
could not go. I carefully placed it among her 
letters and enclosed them in their case. 

Beneath my window I heard Martin Merivale 
reciting from Tennyson, 

" Men my brothers, men the workers, ever reaping 
something new ; 
That which they have done but earnest of the 
things that they shall do." 

And in the room below was Irene's clear, 
birdlike voice singing her morning song : 

" For men may come and men may go, 
But I go on forever." 

I left my room as one in a dream ; but the 
broad day was before me, life with all its 
energy and activity was about me. New joy 
and peace possessed me. Existence held new 
hope. The thought-telegraph was a reaUty. 

That day I received a letter from Helen. 
She was traveling in the south of Europe. 
She wrote : 

" Dear Harold, — 

" The ocean rolls betwixt us. It is easily 
crossed, but the indefinable cloud that has 



EARTH REVISITED. 207 

arisen between us is insurmountable. What is 
it ? Why is it ? We were so happy before 
this affiction befell us which has reft you from 
me, by a barrier worse than death ! For what 
is life without memory ? You once loved me, 
but now you have forgotten me. You forsake 
me for the creatures of your imagination. . . . 
I can write no more. I try to pierce the future, 
but in vain. My heart goes out towards you. 
I send my thoughts through the space between 
us and strive to see you, to pierce the clouds 
and behold your inmost soul : to learn if you 
truly love me or another. I dream of you and 
hold sweet converse in my visions; but the 
days are dark without the light of your eyes 
* to shine amid the gloom.' I can only wait 
in hope for the hour when you will know your 
own heart. Then come to me. Farewell, 
dear Harold; somewhere, sometime, we shall 
meet again, Helen."

XIV. 

As has been well said, some men are like 
mental derricks, hoisting everything within 
reach. Mr. Newcome was one of these. The 
breadth and freedom of his thoughts were like 
the fresh air and siinshine of a bright June 
day to one coming from a crowded, close cathe- 
dral, with its colored windows, unreal figures, 
clouds of incense and intonations in an un- 
known tongue. It was nature, life, contrasted 
with art and unreality. I began to feel a love 
to God and love to man which I had never 
dreamed of as a part of my life. But when 
I left him, I dropped again into my former 
doubts and despondency. 

He had yet heard nothing from Helen. He 
did not seem to know just where she was or 
why she had gone. Upon the latter point 
I had perhaps a clearer notion than he, but he 
did not seem to be at aU anxious about her. 
He was accustomed to the exercise of a great 
degree of freedom on her part. To me, her 
disappearance was but another of the unex- 
plained mysteries with which I was surrounded. 
Her letter with its strange repetition of 
Theresa's words, and of the thought-message, 



EARTH REVISITED, 209 

was another enigma. I could only " wait and 
hope." 

But my loneliness almost overwhelmed me. 
No one in the whole world knew me or could 
understand me. The one whose confidence 
and sympathy I most prized, was yet persist- 
ent in refusing to accept me as I was, still firm 
in the beUef of the mental, aberration of her 
former lover. By no other could I hope to be 
understood or believed. Helen's father, though 
wise and patient in his explanations to me, was 
as far as ever from regarding me in any other 
light than that in which he first beheld me. 
Why should he do so ? Such an experience 
as mine had never been known. Complete loss 
of memory had often occurred to men through 
injury or illness, and its restoration had been 
obtained even after lapse of years. With loss 
of memory had in some cases come recollection 
of former, long-forgotten facts, even of a whole 
language ; but beyond the boundaries of the 
present life, memory had not extended. My 
experience was unique, but no less actual than 
that of others. But this knowledge was all 
my own. My dying prayer had been granted. 
I had been shown the complete futility of my 
former life, the utter emptiness of its vain pur- 
suits ; the suicidal selfishness of its social 
system ; the hoUowness and deception of its 
religious creeds and customs ; its heaven-defy- 
ing pride and folly; its despite to love, it, 
14 



210 EARTH REVISITED. 

bondage to fear, and its turning to the dark- 
ness of human devisings from the broad sun- 
light of God's truth and love. 

I knew not whether other souls had returned 
to earth for their purification, but I realized 
full well my unfitness for any other life, and 
that only here could I obtain the enlighten- 
ment I needed. Only here could I live and 
love and labor. Only on the earth could my 
faculties be made fit for a higher state of ex- 
istence ; only by the fires of discipline can the 
earthy matter be sublimated. 

I could readily conceive that such beings as 
Theresa and all the thronof of innocent infants 
might be fit for instant translation to a better 
world ; but I felt that I had not been made 
worthy therefor by my journey through life, 
though it was all my own misdoing. Man in 
the world is like a traveler lost on a lonely 
island in mid-ocean. He has many talents and 
tastes which find in his circumscribed dwelling- 
place no opportunity for exercise. He has many 
ideas and desires of which he cannot tell the 
origin or end. He has the instinct of the hom- 
ing pigeon. He longs to be set free and fly 
away ; but often, like the weary bird, when 
released he finds not the way to his distant birth- 
place, and returns, sad and sore, to his desert 
island. I perceived the wisdom under these 
circumstances of making the best of my pres- 
ent lot, trusting and obeying the Creator who 



EARTH REVISITED. 211 

implanted these strange instincts in the bird 
and in the human breast. 

From these reflections, I turned for my only 
hope and consolation to Theresa's letters. There 
was the perennial fount of youth and hope. 
There was woman's pure, undying love for man 
and unshaken trust in God. The sadness and 
sorrow of that sweet soul I could never know. 
I read again her reference to Bryant's " Death 
of the Flowers," and could but think how fit- 
tingly it told the story of her sweet life and 
untimely death. 

" Where are the flowers, the fair young flowers, that 

lately sprang and stood. 
In brighter light, and softer airs, a beauteous 

sisterhood ? 
Alas ! they all are in their graves ; the gentle race 

of flowers 
Are lying in their lowly beds, with the fair and 

good of ours. 
And then I think of one who in her youthful 

beauty died, 
The fair, meek blossom that grew up and faded by 

my side. 
In the cold, moist earth we laid her, when the 

forest cast the leaf. 
And we wept that one so lovely should have a life 

so brief." 

I, too, could but weep that one so lovely 
should have a life so brief. I remembered the 
bright and happy future she had pictured for 
herself and me. I recalled her self-renuncia- 
tion in wishing a happy life for me, though her 



212 EARTH REVISITED. 

own misrht be overcast with sorrow. Doubt- 
less she woiihl have had it so ; but early she 
had been removed from a world of suffering, 
and I had toiled on, unblessing and unblessed. 

The "happy future " for us was still in the vast 
depths of futurity. It had been indeed a cold 
world for the fair, young flower. Yet had she 
not died expressing her great desire to see me, 
and blessing me with her latest breath ? Had I 
not seen her at my bedside in my dying hour 
and often beheld her in my dreams? Still later, 
had I not received the message that she lived, 
and seen the strange, written words bidding 
. me come to her? And more precious than all, 
I had beheld her own true imaoe. I had found 
among her letters, a photograph given me by 
her in the early days of our love. With it was 
a simpte pencil sketch of a half-opened rose- 
bud, made and signed with her own hand. How 
aptly had she thus again unconsciously por- 
trayed herself — the fair, unfolded flower of 
womanhood enclosing in its heart the rare, rich 
perfume of virgin love and ])urity. 

Long I gazed upon the speaking image of 
my lost dear one. In the broad, low brow, the 
deep, dark eyes, the rounded face and speaking 
lips, with their cupid's bow compressed to hide 
the evidence of constant pain, I saw again the 
features of my beloved. Here, too, were in- 
tellect, penetration and depth of understand- 
ing, and the look of fearless truthfidness 



EARTH REVISITED. 213 

before which all falseness quails and disap- 
pears. I recalled also a similar expression in 
my daughter and in Helen Newcome. 

I could scarcely lay aside the prized tokens 
to retire. Never had she seemed so near me; 
so real, so truly living. I could almost feel 
"the touch of the vanished hand/' as darkness 
closed around me. Again I dreamed that she 
was with me in all her youthful love and 
beauty. Death was overpast. She conversed 
with me as in the long gone days of our early 
love, living again their joy and peace as she 
had desired to do in our last interview. Then 
I heard her singing in soft, angelic tones her 
favorite song, — 

" Where are the flowers, the fair young flowers," 

and accompanying the heavenly voice were 
strains of sweet, unearthly music, such as never 
fell upon mortal ear. 

Soon I awoke. I knew I was awake, for 
all the objects in my room were plainly 
visible, and through the open door I could 
plainly see Dr. Merivale's cabinet with its 
strange collection of skulls and curiosities. But 
the music continued. Now soft, now loud, 
now sweet, now sad. It was the strange, weird 
music that proceeded from the musical stones. 

I quietly arose and entered the adjoining 
room. There stood Irene Merivale, as I had 



214 EARTH REVISITED, 

before beheld her with her golden locks clus- 
tering over her white robe, playing upon the 
mysterious stones. And the octave was again 
complete. Her large, blue eyes were wide 
open, but she saw me not. With unerring hand 
she struck the notes, evoking music that would 
rival the fabled strains of Orpheus. I dared not 
awaken her, but stood breathless, gazing upon 
the fair phantom. Soon she rose, closed the 
cabinet, and with a blissful smile upon her 
face came straight toward me. As she was 
about to pass me, I grasped her hand. In- 
stantly the whole room seemed to be involved 
in darkness. I stood as if paralyzed, seeing 
nothing, hearing no sound. Presently a small 
spot of light appeared before me and as I 
gazed it gradually grew in size and distinct- 
ness, until it seemed to occupy the entire side 
of the room. Nothing else was visible but 
from the picture, as now it seemed to be, 
streamed a faint, phosphorescent light. My 
eyes were fixed upon the scene before me, while 
it slowly gained in brightness and distinctness. 
At last I was able to make out what appeared 
to be the interior of a room unlike any I had 
ever seen. A lambent light seemed to stream 
into it from above, giving every object an appear- 
ance of strange brightness and beauty. The 
walls were hung with tapestries inw5ven with 
classic legends of Diana, Venus, and ill-fated 
Dido. Soft rugs and furs covered the floors ; 



EAP.TU REVISITED. ily 

Insurious chairs and couches filled the room, 
and within an alcove, between half-di-awn cur- 
tains, I perceived what appeared to be an ivory 
1 couch with rose-coloied coveiiiigs, fit throne 
I for a goddess. Upon one side was an easel with 
an unfinished painting upon it and opposite to 
it, a kind of musical insti'umeut dilferent from 
anything I had ever seen. But the object 
which fixed my gaze and tluilled my heart was 
I the figure of a maiden sitting at the instrument 
I and lightly passing her fingers over its keys. 
' She wa3 di'essed in white with roses in her dark 
hail' and on her bosom. The fonn was that 
of Theresa, but I could not clearly see her face. 
It was bowed over the keys as if in tears, while 
■ her fingers swept slowly over them as if to find 
\ relief from sorrow in their tones. I felt sure 
' it was Theresa. I yearned to comfort her and 
stepped toward her. Involuntarily I stretched 
out my hands to her. As I did so I (lr&lt;)])ped 
that of Irene, when instantly the viaiou vanished. 
Nothing was before me but the form of Irene 
gazing witli wide, unseeing eyes in the direction 
whence the light had come. I was distracted, 
torn between hojte and doubt, joy and disappoint- 
ment. Irene stood fixed as a statue, oblivious 
of my presence. Again, not knowing what I 
did, I grasped her hand. At once the strange 
scene reappeared. But as its features, now 
indelibly burned upon my brain, resumed tlieir 
I outlines and appearance, a vast change was vis- 



216 EARTH REVISITED. 

ible. The weeping maiden had arisen, as if 
suddenly aroused and listening. Her face was 
toward me. It was Theresa. I could not mis- 
take those lineaments ; they were graven on my 
heart and pictured in her photograph. She 
was the same as when I last beheld her in life, 
except her dress. The same tender look of 
love and trust was on her face, the same bright 
smile, the deep, dark eyes yet retaining in 
their limpid depths traces of her earthly sor- 
row. But as she stood and looked toward the 
door, a wondrous change came over her. Sud- 
denly a light of recognition, of angehc ten- 
derness and love, of seraphic joy and peace 
diffused itself over her radiant features and 
illuminated her whole figure with heavenly 
happiness. She stretched out her arms as if 
beholding me, her lips moved and she seemed 
to say, "come to me." She was looking directly 
toward me and seemed to be almost within my 
grasp. 

I was transported by the beautiful vision. I 
knew not where I was. I only knew that I saw 
before me my longed-for love. I could restrain 
myself no more. " I come, I come," I cried and 
started toward the angelic object. 

As I did so, I dropped Irene's hand and again 
the seraphic scene faded from my view. 
There were only Irene and myself in the room. 
An instant she stood gazing blankly as before ; 
I spoke to her, when aroused by my voice, she 



EARTH llEVISITED. 217 

slowly awakened. A moment she stood in 
bewilderment and fear, not knowing where she 
was. Then as she realized her situation, a 
deep blush of confusion spread over her face. 
She clasped her hands to her breast, and with 
a cry of shame and terror fled from the room. 
As she did so a strange object fell at her feet. 
I took it jn my hand and examined it. It was 
the lost fifth — the stolen stone. 

I returned to my room as one who walks on 
air. I could not account for the wonderful 
scene which I had witnessed, nor Irene's par- 
ticipation in it. She seemed to be one of those 
rare natures, easily susceptible to the unseen 
influences which play so important though mys- 
terious a part in our life on this globe and 
serve as a connecting link between those 
sundered by distance or by death. Call it 
mesmerism, hj'^pnotism, unconscious cerebra- 
tion — what you will — yet the mystery remains. 
Heredity stamps its strange composite photo- 
graph upon our faces ; but underneath all, 
pervading all is the image of the soul. I 
could not understand the mysterious influence 
exerted upon Irene and through her upon me ; 
but that I had beheld Theresa, I had no doubt. 
I was also confirmed in my belief in the thought- 
message communicated to me and in the mys- 
terious writing. I felt that my love was daily 
coming nearer, and that in good time we should 
" somewhere, somehow," meet again. 



218 EARTH REVISITED. 

No more slumber visited my eyelids that 
night. The succession o£ wonderful events 
in my experience ran through my mind. I 
recalled my strange translation to another life, 
and the renewal of memory of my past exist- 
ence. All the momentous mystej^ies which had 
met me since I took up my domicile with Mrs. 
Merivale, clamored for explanation. What 
was Irene's connection with these events ? How 
had she discovered the lost fifth and been en- 
abled to play upon the musical stones while yet 
wrapped in slumber ? What invisible electric 
current had completed its circuit through her 
hands to mine and revealed the wondrous vis- 
ion ? Whom had I then beheld ? If my lost love 
were yet living, could she have communicated 
with me through the written messages and 
have been thus pictured to my yearning eyes ? 
And where was Helen Newcome ? I could but 
think of her with pain, that one so fair and 
sweet should meet a fate so sad and strange. It 
seemed that I was doomed to bring but sorrow 
to all connected with me. 

At early dawn I heard Martin Merivale 
reciting beneath my window, "We are such 
stuff as dreams are made of, and all our life is 
rounded with a sleep." I arose, determined to 
fathom the mystery of the dead doctor's cabinet. 
There on the floor lay the lost fifth, a 
crooked, rough stone, apparently the petrified 
bone of a long dead animal. I struck it with a 



EARTH REVISITED. 219 

piece of metal and it gave forth a clear, ringing 
sound as of a belfry chime. I decided to 
replace it with the others and for this purpose 
endeavored to open the doctor's cabinet ; but 
it was securely locked. I paused astonished. 
How had Irene been able to reach the musical 
stones ? She must have had the key. If so she 
may have dropped it where she let fall the 
missing stone — or was it all a dream ? Eagerly 
I returned to my room, and after a careful 
search I found the quaint old key on the floor 
near the spot where the strange stone had 
fallen. 

With eager hand I opened the cabinet. 
There in their glass case lay the musical stones 
in order with the vacant space for the fifth. • I 
replaced it carefully, but as I did so it touched 
its mate and a weird, sweet sound came forth 
as of joy at its restoration. I was startled and 
turned half-expecting to behold their owner by 
my side ; but I saw nothing, though I seemed 
to feel a cool breath on my face, while the gray 
morning light cast a diaphanous shadow upon 
all the objects in the room. 

As I was about to close the cabinet, I heard 
a slight, rustling sound and a light object fell 
to the floor. I hastily closed the cabinet and 
stepping back beheld a roll of manuscript at 
my feet. Mechanically I took it up and bore 
it to my room. I laid it upon the table. I did 
not feel at liberty to open it, thinking it to be 



220 EAHTII REVISITED. 

perhaps some of the deceased physician's cor- 
respondence. But while I gazed upon it the 
morning light streamed into my room and I 
read the superscription in a large bold hand : 
" To my dear daughter, Irene. A father's last 
bequest." It seemed strange that this manu- 
script should have lain so long unheeded, but I 
remembered Mrs. Merivale's religious venera- 
tion for her husband's memory and the awe 
she felt for all his belongings. As for Irene, 
she was apparently unaware of her midnight 
visits to her father's cabinet. 

" Here," thought I, " may perchance, be 
found a clew to her strange conduct. I will 
glance over the writing. It may contain mat- 
ters of importance to the widow which she may 
not otherwise learn." 

I opened and read. But from the first sen- 
tence I was possessed with a consuming interest 
and paused not until the last word was perused. 
It was headed : 

" The Confession of a Scientist. 

"My dear daughter, I am dying; that is 
to say, the unknown principle called life is 
about to loosen its hold upon the particles of 
my material frame and let it fall again to dust. 
Earth to earth is the law of nature. Against 
this it is useless to rebel. I do not do so, but 
0, my child, how can I leave you thus ! Most 



EARTH REVISITED. 221 

grievously have I wronged you. Most gladly 
would I repair that wrong, but now it is too late. 
0, the inexorableness of time ! What would I 
not give for a portion of that elixir of life, in 
the search for which I have spent ten years of 
my allotted span in an enthusiastic endeavor to 
lengthen the stay of mortal man on this poor 
planet. Long life is not an unmixed good. 
Why should man dread its termination or seek 
to extend it, only that he may do his work here 
while yet it is day ? But my work is done. 
And how shall I sum it up ? I have alleviated 
a little physical suffering, prolonged many use- 
less lives, and exhausted my own in seeking the 
means of purchasing a lease of life for others. 
" But not of these things do I write to you, 
my injured daughter. I would kneel at your 
feet and beg your forgiveness. But now, alas ! 
it is beyond your power to grant it, or mine to 
repair the evil I have done. I intended to un- 
do it ere too late, but now I can only make this 
confession to you with my last hours. To no 
other human being would I make it. As you 
may know, I have always been a strong-willed, 
self-reHant man. I am not yet forty years of age, 
but I have made a name in my profession and 
in the world of science, more particularly in the 
new field of psychical investigation. Men no 
longer refuse to give the name of science to 
facts above their comprehension or beyond the 
narrow range of physical investigation. The 



222 EARTH REVISITED, 

famed inductive method has long since reached 
its limitations, and men have ceased to pride 
themselves upon their scientific knowledge. 
Their vaunted science was but picking up dry 
driftwood on the shores of time, tying it into 
bundles and af&amp;xing a label thereto in a foreign 
tongue. They have not increased the boun- 
daries of actual knowledge, but have only cleared 
the way for the advance into the universe of 
the Unknown. For this service we give them 
thanks. But their work is done, and men now 
begin to apprehend real knowledge. 

" As has been well said, ^ There is no other 
way to account for energy in matter and the 
conservation of force than by the direct and 
present volition of God in each atom. The 
groping of physical scientists without this idea 
was senseless and unscientific. The universe is 
one. There is no supernatural ; all is natural. 
All is related — mind, matter and morals — ^all is 
continuous, here and hereafter. As to con- 
tinuity of life, we feel that we reach back by 
birthright and will continue on by right of pos- 
session.' 

" All honest investigation however slight, 
in whatever direction pursued, soon comes up 
against the invisible wall of the unknown Force, 
the adamantine circle within which we live and 
move and have our being. The moles of phys- 
ical science creep along under ground and declare 
theje is no sun in heaven. ' Men say they will 



EARTH REVISITED. 223 

not believe what they cannot understand, and 
yet believe in their own children.' The most 
patient investigator with his scales and lenses, 
cannot find the source of life. The true scien- 
tist cannot always be content with investigating 
merely the methods of existence, but mlist at 
List knock at the door of the great Unknown 
and pray for admittance. The universal law 
of the ' Persistence of Force ' is but the thought 
of the great Thinker. Men have ceased to pick 
up sticks. The phenomena of the mind, the 
spirit, the being of man, have always been the 
most potent and prominent features of human 
experience. Yet at first, superstition awed men 
from their investigation ; then religion sought 
to append these facts to her exclusive domain, 
while science affected to despise them, because, 
forsooth, they could not be tested in her tubes, 
and charlatans made merchandise of them. 
The formation of the Society for Psychical 
Research in the last decade of the nineteenth 
century, was the first rational attempt to solve 
the secrets that surround huuian Ufe in the 
world. ' All flesh is grass,' said tlie ancient 
aage, and tlie physical scientist can say no more. 
Yet the thinker in all ages can but ask, ' Is not 
man more than matter? Are the phenomena 
of mind hut forms of force, or is there some- 
thing in ns and about us, unknown and unap- 
prehended by our five senses, which yet rules 
and dominates our lives? 



224 EARTH BE VISITED. 

" As Lessingsays upon the doctrine of trans- 
migration of souls : ' At present the soul has 
five senses ; but neither is there any right to 
assume that it has commenced with having five 
senses, nor that it will stop there. Since 
nature contains many substances and powers 
which are not acceptable to those senses with 
which it is now endued, it must be assumed 
that there will be future stages at which the 
soul will have as many senses as correspond 
with the powers of nature. This is certainly 
the oldest of all philosophical systems, for it is 
no other than the system of the pre-existence 
of the soul and of metempsychosis, which did 
not only occupy the speculation of Pythagoras 
and Plato, but also before them of Egyptians, 
Chaldeans, and Persians, in short of all the 
sages of the East ; and this circumstance alone 
ought to work a good prejudice in its favor, 
for the first and oldest opinion is, in matters of 
speculation, always the most probable because 
common-sense immediately hit upon it.' 

" Socrates, questioning the ignorant slave boy, 
brought out his assent to the truths of geom- 
etry and thus demonstrated that ideas are innate 
and concluded, that as they are inborn in all, 
they must have been brought with us into the 
world. And his pupil, Plato, says : ' The 
possession of intuitive ideas and the faculty of 
recognizing absolute truth, show that man must 
have derived these ideas from a previous state 



EARTH REVISITED, 225 

of existence/ So also the theologians can ac- 
count for the origin of evil only upon the hy- 
pothesis of a former life, whence we have 
brought it with us into our present state. 

" These ideas, at an early age, took possession 
of my mind. I could not follow the fantastic 
fancies of the Hindoos and the Hebrew Cab- 
balists as to the transmigration of human souls 
through the bodies of animals and inanimate 
objects ; but that the souls of men might return 
to earth in other bodies, seemed to me to be an 
idea peculiarly reasonable and fraught with much 
less difficulty than any other theory of exist- 
ence. Of course, if memory be not continued, 
the old life is practically lost to the new man ; 
but who can say that it is not restored in 
another state? without it is no immortality. 
At all events, I followed this line of thought 
and investigation. I considered the possi- 
bility of my being the renewed life of a 
long-departed being. That one might be, as 
it were, the soul-chUd of an unknown father, 
while his body was the offspring of living pa- 
rents, seemed not an unreasonable belief. This 
finally took such possession of my mind that 
when my faithful father expired, I followed him 
to the grave with the conviction and grim con- 
solation that he was not my real father. I was 
the child of his flesh, but I fancied that my 
soul-father was the poet Byron, that in me he 
lived again and my tumultuous heart throbbed 



226 EARTH REVISITED. 

with the passions and sorrows which possessed 
him. I felt that he, burdened by the sins of 
his ancestors, had not had a fair chance in life, 
and that now with honest, humble parentage, 
transplanted to the pure atmosphere of the new 
world, his valiant, liberty-loving soul might find 
free development and growth. 
" As Tennyson sings : 

" ' All thoughts, all creeds, all dreams are true, 

All visions wild and strange ; 
Man is the measure of all truth 
Unto himself. All truth is change; 

All men do walk in sleep, and all 
Have faith in that they dream ; 

For all things are as they seem to all, 

And all things flow like a stream.' 

" It was also from my early years, a favorite 
theory of mine that the human mind could im- 
press itself upon other minds without the inter- 
vention of sound or speech or any sense-per- 
ception. ' Thoughts are things ! ' The air is 
full of untold secrets. 

" Incidents of this nature frequently occurred 
in my own experience, or coincidences, as they 
were formerly called in the unscientific language' 
of the past. As well might it be said that the 
explosion of nitro-glycerine is a coincidence. 

" I had frequently attempted hypnotic exper- 
iments with varying success, before I met your 
mother. But from the moment when I first fixed 



EARTH REVISITED. 227 

my eyes upon her, she came wholly under my in- 
fluence. She was mine, with her whole nature, 
her intellect, affections and will. She loved 
me fondly and I found in her the sole solace 
of my life. She truly had no thought but 
mine. She was not hypnotized, so much as 
self-surrendered. I could make her do my 
will, whether present or absent. But it was the 
submission of love. The conquest was too easy 
to satisfy my ambition. I sought another sub- 
ject on which to test my power. 

'' When you came, our first-born, you were a 
Uving miracle to me. By the hour I sat beside 
your crib and pondered upon the mystery of 
your coming. The babe, so weak, so helpless, 
so innocent! Yet how mighty, how myste- 
rious ! how vast its possibilities for good or 
evil ! I watched for the first unfoldings of 
intelligence, of reason and of moral perception, 
with infinite interest and instruction. I beheld 
with awe the first manifestations of heredity. 
I sought to know whence came its first ideas of 
self, of externality, of cause, effect, love, fear and 
right. My child became to me at length merely 
a marvelous mechanism. I had brought her 
into the world, but her soul was an independent 
existence. Whence it came I knew not ; it 
was a stranger to me. Instead of welcoming 
It I questioned it, opposed it, sought to con- 
trol it. But you were not like your mother. 
Your spirit was strong and free as that of the 



228 EARTU REVISITED. 

mountain lark, which would not be confinsd 
or sing another song. I could not resist the 
temptation to test my hyi)notie powers upon 
you. Before you were out of the cradle the 
contest began. Long and fierce was the 
struggle of the eagle, that would not be con- 
fined by the invisible toils. But at length I 
conquered. Not knowing it, you did my silent 
bidding. Arrested in your gayest song, you 
knew not whence or why, you ceased singing 
until I bade you be free again. Even when 
invisible and at a distance, vou were led to 
walk in the paths that I appointed. I rejoiced 
in my unsuspected powers. I gloried in the 
power of the will by which I could burst the 
bonds of the body and be a free untrammeled 
intellect. 

" In time, it came to be, that by a mere 
voUtion I could cast the unsuspected spell upon 
you and transfer all my powers to you, as an 
unconscious instrument in my hands. Thus I 
taught you to play upon the musical stones, 
yourself all unaware of your accomplishment 
and of the power which possessed you. 

" But now I have awakened to the enormity 
of my act. I have invaded the sanctity of a 
human soul and overthrown the God-given 
majesty of the will. I have entered the inmost 
citadel of being and destroyed the divinity 
that dwells within. And this was the soul of 
my own child 5 an immortal essence committed 



EABTTI REVISITED, 229 

to my care and training for a brief period. 
But now my opportunity is passed. I cannot 
now set free the imprisoned lark. It has for- 
gotten its heaven-born song and its wings are 
powerless to rise. 

" My child, can you forgive a dying man ? — 
Your father, I dare not call myself, for such I 
have not been. I am about to leave ^ the pale 
glimpses of the moon ' and be seen here no 
more. Soon the great mystery will be revealed 
to me; or I shall rest unknowing with the 
clods of the valley, springing with the grass, 
blossoming into fruitage, soaring with the bird, 
or coursing in the veins of another race of 
men. 

" But what of thee, my daughter ? Who 
will lead your wavering steps, direct your 
thoughtless mind, guide your feeble will ? 0, 
my child, I cannot die and leave thee thus ! 
I will not die ! Nay, though my body moulder 
in the grave, I yet will walk abroad. No man 
can die wTiose will is not destroyed. Death I 
defy. 

" When you read this, know that Ilarlowe 
Merivale is not dead.'' 

I dropped the manuscript, and as the yellow 
sheets curled upon the floor, I sprang to my 
feet almost expecting to see Doctor Merivale 
by my side or feel the touch of his invisible 
hand. I was confounded by what I had read. 
Could a man thus practice his strange experi- 



230 EARTH BE VI SITED, 

ments upon his own flesh and blood ? Was it 
possible to extend that power beyond the 
grave? But as I recalled Irene's strange 
appearance, the weird light in her eye, her 
rapid transitions from birdlike, animal inno- 
cence and joy to uncaused sadness and unrea- 
soning action, and above all, what I alone 
knew, her mysterious powers in moments of 
unconsciousness by which she found her 
father's cabinet and produced the mystic music, 
I could but believe that Doctor Merivale still 
swayed the mind ,and held the hand of his 
unfortunate child. 

The widow's superstitions were indeed, not 
all imagination. Her husband was perchance, 
nearer than I thought, and it was his power 
that waked again the singing stones and cheered 
his loving spouse in the dim watches of the 
nig-ht.

" O Love ! in every battle victor crowned." 

Sophocles. 

The reading of Dr. Merivale's manuscript 
gave me a tenfold interest in Irene. I knew 
that certain persons were easily made the 
hypnotic subjects of others, but I had never 
known of a man's thus throwing that influence 
over his own child. But besides and beyond 
this, it seemed almost incredible that such in- 
fluence could continue after death. Yet, if this 
were the case, what stronger evidence could be 
given of the continuation of life after disso- 
lution of the body. The only other tenable 
theory that I could devise, by which to explain 
Irene's conduct, was that she still continued, 
unknown to herself, under the power formerly 
exerted by her father, and in a sort of somnam- 
bulism, performed feats impossible to her in her 
waking hours. But such theories as this ex- 
plain nothing. The facts of somnambidism are 
as inexplicable as any that attend our terrestrial 
existence. I had seen Irene but a few moments 
since our midnight meeting. As Hooked upon 



232 EARTU REVISITED, 

her fair young face with its innocent expres- 
sion of animal life and joy, I could catch no 
trace of recognition or recollection of her part 
in our strange encounter. Her gay laughter 
rang through the room like the song of her 
canary, and her light figure flitted about the 
house as careless and happy as that of her kit- 
ten. Indeed, after reading her father's confes- 
sion, I somewhat questioned whether she pos- 
sessed a human soul; whether independent 
volition and moral responsibility were truly 
hers. She seemed to be blown hither and 
thither by every breeze, and like the leaf upon 
the stream, to be carried by unseen currents 
whither she knew not. Yet, I could but re- 
flect, how much of all human life and destiny 
is thus determined by forces without our ken 
or control, set in motion, perhaps, long before 
our birth and warping us unconsciously to un- 
seen ends. 

As I sat in my room at Mrs. Merivale's one 
evening, not long after reading the doctor's 
confession, I fell to thinking about Helen New- 
come. " Where is she ? Why does she thus 
absent herself? Why thus conceal herself 
from me ? " I reflected. " Not one word or mes- 
sage have I received from her since her abrupt 
departure. Does she still love me ? If so, how 
can she thus desire to be separated from me ? 
It is entirely of her own volition, for did she 
not in her last message say that it was useless 



EARTH UEVllSiTED, 233 

for me to follow her, and that some time we 
might meet again ? '' I did not doubt her love. 
I knew such an affection could never wane ; 
that our experience in the anemon and our last 
happy stroll together in the park, could never 
be forgotten. My heart was tender toward her, 
though it was entirely occupied by the image 
of Theresa. Before that shrine the fires of 
memory never ceased to burn. 

As thus I sat in the dim shadows that played 
about the room, my heart went out still more 
toward Helen, until invohmtarily I breathed 
her name and sighed : " Helen, where are 
you ? Do you think of me now ? " 

As I spoke, I heard a light step beside me, a 
soft hand touched mine and a sweet voice 
whispered : " Dear Harold." 

A moment I sat in joyful awe doubting if I 
could have heard aright. I said to myself : 
^' It must be imagination." But there lay that 
small, white hand on mine, and 'a round, bare 
arm rested upon my shoulder. Slowly I turned 
to scan the fair visitant, whose golden locks 
fell upon a snowy breast, and whose sweet 
breath fanned my cheek. As I did so I beheld 
Irene. There was no doubt of her identity, 
while at the same time there was no mistaking 
the look that fell upon me from her large blue 
eyes, the glow that suffused her cheek, the 
soft smile that lurked in the dimples of her rosy 
mouth, the warmth and tenderness of her touch. 



234 EARTH REVISITED, 

It was love. It was the expression o£ one 
completely possessed by an irresistible pas- 
sion. 

" Irene ! " I exclaimed in my astonishment. 
" Irene, why are you here ? " 

" Did you not call for me, dear Harold/' she 
responded in sweet accents, while her eye 
beamed upon me with intense affection and her 
moist hand grasped mine with a stronger clasp. 
Could this be Irene, the light-hearted creature 
of the morning ? Had she hitherto been able 
to conceal her growing passion for me which 
now had burst the bonds of maidenly reserve ? 
I could not think thus of Irene. The love 
which now possessed her was, evidently, a new 
and sudden inspiration. Whence it came, I 
could not know, but of its reality and power I 
could not doubt. 

" Dear Harold," again those sweet tones 
sounded, " surely you did call for me. Gladly 
I came to you. I am thine. Why do you 
not speak to me ? Do you not love me ? " 
Love you ! " I murmured, unconsciously. 

Who could help loving such a vision of youth 
and beauty ? " 

"Do you not know me, Harold? " again the 
sweet being whispered, as she drew closer to 
me, until her deep eyes looked into mine and 
her warm lips almost touched my cheek. 
" Harold, have you forgotten our afternoon in 
heaven, in the air-ship ; our last wa,lk together 






EARTH REVISITED. 235 

in the park, our vows, our love, our last kiss ; 
this dress, this rose ? " 

She clasped her hand to her bosom, half 
hidden by her white robe, which, however, held 
no rose, quickly imprinted a warm kiss upon 
my cheek and sprang from me. I started to 
my feet as one enchanted. I saw nothing but 
the fair form before me so tantaUzingly near. 
I heard naught but the words of love and passion. 
I felt her moist kiss burn upon my cheek. The 
blood of youth mounted in my veins ; I sprang 
toward her; I opened my arms to embrace her ; 
I exclaimed, " Come to me ! " when, in an in- 
stant — I know not how — while I gazed upon 
her, the fair being before me was changed. 
She was no longer the figure of love, of ten- 
derness, and fervent passion, but the gay, care- 
less, soulless Irene. An instant she stood 
smiling, taunting, while I gazed upon her ag 
one entranced; then with a quick, bird-like 
chirp, she turned and flitted lightly from the 
room. 

The door closed, and I was again alone. 
Had I been dreaming ? No. I was never 
more alert, more sure of myself and my sur- 
roundings. It was not yet late in the evening. 
Without, I heard the voices of people passing, 
and above me in Irene's room I heard her sing- 
ing at her toilet : 

" So I tell them they needn't come wooing to me, 
For my heart, O, my heart, is over the sea." 



236 EAR TH HE VJJSITED. 

Who had been my visitor? Evidently it 
was Irene. But what had caused her to come 
to me at that time with that expression and 
those burning words of love ? Whence had 
she derived the knowledge to which she had 
referred, of tender scenes known only to Helen 
Newcome and myself ? I could find no answer 
to these queries. 1 determined as a final 
recourse to ask Irene herself at the first oppor- 
tunity. 

The next morning, at the earliest occasion, 
I called Irene aside and lightly alluded to our 
meeting. But it brought no blush to her 
cheek, no looTc or word of recognition. I then 
asked her plainly why she had come to my 
room the evening before, when, to my utter 
astonishment, she disavowed all knowledge of 
it and declared that she had not left her room 
that night. 

" Why do you ask such foolish questions ? " 
she laughingly exclaimed, as she turned away, 
with a light and innocent air which I could not 
possibly connect with the appearance of my 
strange visitant. I was convinced that in some 
manner she must have been unconscious of 
her act, even as when wrapt in slumber she 
had sought her father's cabinet and wrung the 
chimes upon the musical stones. She was evi- 
dently subject to influences beyond my ken or 
conjecture. 

One morning, a few days later, Irene again 



EARTH REVISITED, 237 

appeared to me. This time she was calm, 
serious, positive. " You must go with me/' 
she said, earnestly. 

" Where must I go ? " I asked, carelessly. 

" I do not know," she replied. " But one 
who loves you has sent for you. I do not 
know where she is, but I am drawn toward her. 
I feel like a bird impelled, it knows not how, to 
fly away to other climes. I will find her ; but 
you must go with me. Come ! I am eager to 
be on the wing." 

" How will we go ? " I asked, more to test 
her purpose than thinking to take her words in 
seriousness. 

" By anemon," she quickly replied. " You 
will engage one, with a guide, and make prep- 
arations for a long voyage. Haste," she con- 
cluded, impatiently. '^Love is drawing us. 
Your lover awaits you. Haste, let us fly 
away ! " 

Thoughts of Helen, of Theresa, of all the 
mysteries that had met me in this new world, 
rushed upon me and bade me obey. I knew 
not whence the source of Irene's inspiration. 
I had ceased to seek to understand the reasons 
for conduct ere I should act. All life is a 
mystery. We live from moment to moment, 
hour to hour, year to year, only in the instant 
of time called the present. We seek to supply 
its pressing wants, gratify its passing pleasure, 
do its little duties, when — presto ! it vanishes, 



238 EARTH REVISITED, 

— and we disappear. The world moves on, 
but we ai*e not in it, or of it. I decided to go 
with Irene. 

My preparations were soon made. I pro- 
cured an anemon with an experienced conduc- 
tor and perfected my plans for a long absence, 
if necessary. 

Irene was all uneasiness and excitement 
until we were ready to depart. Then an un- 
expected change came over her. All her for- 
mer volubility left her. A calm seriousness 
and fixedness of purpose took possession of her. 
An appearance of dignified reserve and a sense 
of responsibility were manifested in all her 
words and demeanor. 

As we entered the anemon, our guide asked 
for his sailing orders. I could give none. 
Irene was consulted. She was at first unable 
to give any intelligible directions. "Sail to- 
wards the south, towards the sunshine," was 
aU she could say. Finally a compass was 
brought. Its points were explained to her, 
when, suddenly pointing to the southeast, she 
exclaimed, " Go that way. Keep that course 
until I tell you to change." The conductor 
looked confused. " Why, that takes us into 
the midst of the Atlantic Ocean," he remarked, 
turning to me. " But I can give you no other 
directions," I replied, " we will follow her de- 
cision. It may change at any moment." 

No more was said. We mounted the shin-

ing, electric bird, were enclosed in the glass 
carriage and shot upward and onward. Far 
and fast from all the world of men we sped. 
Soon the Atlantic surf sounded in our ears, and 
the solid earth on which man is born and builds, 
and in which he is buried, was left far from 
sight and sound. Only the tumultuous waves 
of ocean rolled beneath and the clouds of 
heaven about us. 

Straight and swift we kept our course — a 
veritable bee-line, which only the untaught in- 
stinct of the insect could trace in the viewless 
air. Straight southeast we flew, toward the 
equator and the " Dark Continent," as Africa 
was called in my day. Hardly a word had 
escaped from Irene since we started. In the 
extreme bow of the air-ship she sat, peering 
eagerly forth into space, as if seeking to 
urge the flying vessel faster forward in its 
flight. On, on, we sped all day over the watery 
wastes. As darkness came on, a bright electric 
light was hung out from our bow, and still on 
we flew through the night, a shooting star, 
guiding its living freight to the land of love 
and light. 

When morning dawned, our course was yet 
unchanged. But the Atlantic billows no longer 
rolled beneath us. A three months' voyage 
had been accomplished in twenty hours. I 
asked our guide what land was in view and 
he answered, " Africa. Shall I change our 



240 EAUTll REVISITED, 

course?" he asked. But Irene gave no sign 
and we flew straight on. 

" We must be over the desert of Sahara," I 
remarked to our conductor. 

" Yes ; it was formerly so-called," he an- 
swered, " but there is no such place now. It 
has disappeared like the ' Great American 
Desert' which once ornamented the maps of 
the United States. Modern engineering has 
converted a large portion of it into a lake or 
inland sea, and the remainder into oases of 
fertility. The Central African Railroad runs 
directly across it, extending from Algiers to 
the Congo. The whole region is filled with 
populous cities and fruitful fields. Africa is 
again, as in Roman days, the granary of the 
world, and also now the chief source of its 
cotton supply." 

" I remember," said I, " how Stanley ex- 
plored the Congo and pierced the heart of the 
Dark Continent, until his day, the enigma of 
the world. And what a work he did for civil- 
ization and humanity in reveaUng the horrors 
which festered there and awakening the atten- 
tion of the world to their enormity ! " 

" We are now over the Stanley State," in- 
terposed my companion. " All central Africa, 
including the Congo Free State and the Soudan, 
are united in a grand and prosperous confedera- 
tion, named in honor of the great discoverer 
and philanthropist, Stanley and Livingston, 



EARTH BE VISI TED. 241 

the Christian heroes of the nineteenth century, 
are the patron saints of Africa. The African 
in America has carried the torch of truth to the 
Dark Continent. The existence of the evils 
you mention seem to us now almost inconceiv- 
able, so great a change have the united and or- 
ganized efforts of Christian nations wrought in 
Africa. The poet's prophecy is fulfilled, even 
here: 

" ' For the war drum throbs no longer, and the battle 

flags are furled; 
In the Parliament of man, the Federation of the 

world.' 

" When civilized nations began to expend 
one tithe of the energy and treasure in the en- 
lightment of foreign peoples, that they had for- 
merly expended in subduing them, and in mak- 
ing war upon each other, the results were in- 
credibly beneficent. The work of five centuries 
was accomplished in one. When missionaries 
and Bibles were no longer accompanied by rum 
and rifles, the benighted mind was found to 
grasp with unsuspected alacrity the idea of 
human fellowship and divine love. It was an 
experiment the world had never tried before." 

" Stop, stop ! " suddenly exclaimed Irene, 
who still sat at the prow peering steadily before 
her. Her white hand waved command. " Stop ! 
Descend ! " she ordered. Immediately the huge 
fan-wheels ceased to revolve as the electric cur- 
rent was turned off: the buoyant gas was 
16 



242 EARTH UE VISITED. 

allowed to escape and we slowly settled to the 
earth. 

A large and beautiful town soon appeared 
beneath us with numerous towers and minarets, 
its broad streets and plazas shaded by tall palm 
trees, while silvery streams and lakes intersected 
it in every direction, giving it the appearance 
of an inland Venice. Electric gondolas plied 
its waters like swift swans, gliding gracefully 
hither and thither, stately camels stalked its 
streets beside the electric curricles, while the 
warm glow of a tropical sun suffused the air 
laden with the perfume of myriad flowers and 
pulsating with the sound of silver bells. 

We alighted before a small, elegantly-shaped 
edifice surmounted by a mosque-like dome which 
gleamed in the sun like marble, between the 
shadows of the palm trees, while broad verandas 
and rose-embowered alcoves invited to comfort 
and repose. A Sabbath stillness and calm 
rested upon all the place. No apparent signs 
of occupation were to be seen. Was this the 
end of our long journey ? For what purpose 
we had sped across the trackless ocean and 
pierced to the center of this unknown continent, 
I could not conceive. I turned to Irene. A 
marked change had come over her countenance. 
The expression of eager search and anxious in- 
quiry had given place to one of complete joy and 
supreme satisfaction. Like a bird freed from 
its prison, she flitted about in gay unreflecting 



EARTH REVISITED. 243 

gladness. I watched her closely to learn the 
end and object of our strange journey, but it 
did not now seem to concern her in the least. 
The old Irene was returning. 

" Why do you stand here gazing about you ? " 
she exclaimed. " Press the button and enter. 
I leave you here. I am satisfied. FareweU, 
my friend, farewell. Don't forget your good 
angel/' she gayly exclaimed. 

" Away I fly, so glad, so free ! 
Away, away, o'er the deep blue sea," 

she sang, as she waved her slender hand in adieu. 
In an instant she had re-entered the anemon, 
and was fast rising into the blue ether above 
me. The words 

" Fare thee well, and if forever, still, forever, fare 
. thee well," 

fell upon my ear from the air above. Smaller 
and smaller grew the bright speck, and in an 
instant my "good angel" had vanished into 
the fathomless expanse of heaven. 

A moment I stood in bewilderment and doubt. 
Here was I, transported in a few hours from 
the wintry air of the western continent to the 
heart of Africa, from the land of science and 
civilization to the land of palms and camels, 
the ancient seat of darkness and mystery. So 
suddenly had my guide disappeared and so little 
explanation or direction had been given me. 



244 EARTH REVISITED. 

that I knew no more of the object o£ my com- 
ing than when I started. There was, however, 
nothing for me to do but to obey her orders, 
press the electric button and enter the beauti- 
ful dwelling. 

As I did* so, the door softly swung open, like 
the gate of heaven " on golden hinges turning," 
and a clear, silvery voice bade me welcome. 
As I entered, I stood upon marble floors, cov- 
ered with skins of beasts, while beautiful 
statues, reflected from many mirrors, seemed 
to smile upon me and to be a gracious company 
awaiting my arrival. Before me a graceful 
winding stairway of ivory led to the upper 
regions ; and, as I stood, doubting, wondering, 
admiring, a voice strangely sweet and familiar 
invited me to ascend. I obeyed, though almost 
fearing to place my feet upon the light and 
airy structure. Slowly I ascended, while, my 
throbbing heart beat almost audibly in the 
noonday stillness, and my foot-falls seemed a 
desecration in the temple of a goddess. 

Before me, as I reached the floor above, was 
an elegant apartment, apparently a maiden's 
boudoir. The door stood wide open and all 
its elegant interior was visible. As I caught a 
sight of the room, I involuntarily started back 
in astonishment and awe. I had seen it all be- 
fore ! but when ? where ? It was the room 
revealed in the vision of the night in Brooklyn, 
by the hand of Irene Merivale, Every detail

was reproduced. The tapestries on the walls, 
the ivory couch, the paintings, the musical 
instruments, all were familiar, indelibly en- 
graved upon my mind. And what vision of 
loveliness and beauty stood before me ? There, 
just risen from her piano, clad in clinging robes 
of pearly white, with roses at her breast and in 
her hair, her noble face illumined by a smile of 
joy, with outstretched hands, stood the angel 
of my vision. 

Glad recognition gleamed in every feature, 
made radiant with love and happiness. The 
rosy lips parted, and in sweet accents that 
thrilled my soul with tender recollections, 
breathed my name in familiar, never-to-be-for- 
gotten tones, " Dear Harold." These were the 
words of Theresa's letters, that recalled the 
expression and utterance of her love ; the words 
repeated by Helen Newcome at our parting, 
with a cadence which strangely thrilled me with 
dim unrecognized suggestions and filled my 
heart with joy. The being of my vision stood 
before me. Again she whispered, " Come to 
me." Again stretched out her arms to me. 
Yet for a moment I stood irresolute, awed, un- 
certain. 

" Who are you ? " I murmured. 

" Do you not know me, Harold ? " she sighed. 
" Do you not know Helen Newcome ? ' 

" Helen ! " I exclaimed in wonder, and ad- 
vanced to meet her. 



246 EARTU REVISITED. 

Not a step did she move toward me. She 
stood inviting, yet anxiously awaiting my ap- 
proach, scanning my face with ardent eye to 
learn if love, love only, true, tender, and irre- 
sistible, drew me to her. 

At that instant such a passion possessed me, 
that I sprang to her with outstretched arms 
and enfolded her fair form with the strong 
embrace of true, manly, unquestioning affec- 
tion. She was satisfied. Undisguised happiness 
and love beamed from her eye, spoke in her 
lips, and caressed me in her touch. Again her 
sweet, musical voice sounded in my ears and 
her words set all my soul in glad vibration as 
she spoke. 

" Dear Harold, I am rejoiced that you have 
come. I have guided you to this place ; but 
freely, fondly, you have followed, and now I 
see, I know, you love me. No more shadows 
can come between us. I felt before that there 
was a divided affection in your heart and I 
could not abide its presence. But, now, it is 
one. Now it is mine in truth, and naught on 
earth shall part us." 

With a trustful, tender look, she turned her 
face upward to me and rested confident and 
happy on my breast. And truly I did love her 
at that moment. All my heart was drawn to 
her by an invisible, unreasoning, yet irresistible 
attraction, like that of steel to an unseen mag- 
net, I could not reason. I could not reflectt 



EARTH REVISITED. 247 

I could but yield to the strange power that 
possessed me. Yet, as I sat there, clasping her 
little hand in mine, listening to the throbbing 
of her happy heart, my eyes were drawn to 
the view before me. The room and all its 
furnishings were the same that I had seen in 
my vision ; the strange musical instrument 
stood open, as if the fingers of its fair owner 
had just swept over them telling the tale of 
her love and grief. Her image seemed to stand 
beside it as I had seen her, just risen, expectant, 
vibrating with love and hope and joy, with 
arms extended to greet her welcome visitant. 
I could contain my curiosity no longer. 

" Helen," I exclaimed, "I have seen all this 
before. This room, these tapestries, that in- 
strument, and you, as you met me ; I have 
seen before." 

" Ah, I have seen you, too, dear Harold," 
she replied. " Many times in my dreams, by 
night and by day, I have seen you entering 
that door. Many times I have almost sprung 
to my feet, as I listened for your footfall 'on 
the stair. Do you know that I came to know 

iroui footstep at my father's house, in Brook- 
yn, where you came so often to consult him 
and see me, after your— your accident and 
illness ? But I had learned it before, Harold, 
in those dear old days, ^ when we were first 
acquaint,' now doubly dear to me, since to you 
they are no more. Yes, often in my day-dreams 



248 EARTU REVISITED. 

too, I have followed you in your distant home, 
and waited, weeping, yet trusting for the day 
when your eager footsteps should turn again to 
me, when your heart would bid you seek me and 
guide you to my side. Yes, I have often lived 
this hour." 

" But I have not been dreaming," I replied. 
" I have seen all this before, and awake, fully, 
fiercely awake to the wondrous vision. In my 
chamber at Mrs. Merivale's, at midnight, in 
the darkness, I saw this room in all its elegant 
details, these tapestries and pictures, that ivory 
couch — fit throne for a goddess — that instru- 
ment, and that fair form clad as now, in virgin 
white, yet sad and weeping, bending over the 
keys, telling them the story of grief, seek- 
ing in sweet music solace for the burdened 
heart and occupation for the lonely hours." 

As I described that scene, Helen seized my 
arm with an eager grasp and looked into my 
face with wondering inquiry and whispered, 
" How could you have seen that ? " 

"And I saw again," I continued, "the same 
figure with love and gladness in her eyes, risen 
to greet her lover, even as you stood to welcome 
me to-day; — but it was not Helen Newcome 
that I saw." 

" Not I ? " exclaimed Helen. " Surely it was 
I that you beheld. It was I that rose to greet 
you ; it is I that drew you hither ; whom else 
could you have seen ? " 



EARTH nEVTSITED. I&gt;i0 

At that question all the tide of past memories 
rushed over me. Theresa stood before me with 
her sad, searching eyes and bade me tell the 
truth. 

" I will tell you all, Helen ; then perhaps you 
will love me no more. It was not you that I 
saw in my vision — it was Theresa." 

" Ah ! that name/' murmured she, " the 
name by which you called me when first recov- 
ering from your illness ; the name which again 
you called, when in my dream, I saw you sink- 
ing in the waves ; the name of her who has 
divided your heart with me ; ah ! tell me truly, 
Harold, who is she ? " 

A slight tremor swept through her slender 
frame as she spoke ; yet she clung closer to me 
and looked up into my face with that expression 
of deep, unfathomable trust and confidence 
which only loving woman can give and which 
a true man can but behold with humility and 
fear. 

I told her all my story. I told of my first 
true love of a century before, of her sorrow and 
her death ; of my selfish, sinful life, its wretch- 
edness and failure, and my despairing death. 
I described to her, while she listened in breath- 
less awe, the vision of Theresa standing by my 
side, and her bright, beckoning smile, as I de- 
parted. Then came an unbridged chasm, un- 
til the moment when I recovered from my ill- 
ness, a century later, and thought I saw Theresa 



250 EARTH REVISITED, 

still standing beside me. " It was indeed Love, 
in another form ; but not less fair and sweet," 
I added, with a soft pressure of Helen's hand. 
But she did not seem to notice it. Her eyes 
were fixed before her and her deep, slow breath- 
ing told of the strength of the hidden emotions 
that my story had aroused. 

Then I told her of my strange discoveries in 
New York, the confirmation of my beliefs, the 
records of the past, and, above all, of the find- 
ing of Theresa's letters and her photograph. 

" Tell me of them, quick," almost gasped 
Helen, as she seized my hand and breathless 
hung upon my words. 

I repeated many passages from those letters, 
for they were graven on my memory too deeply 
to be effaced. I recalled the Unes on the death 
of the flowers, her frequent expressions of love 
and confidence as she wrote the name " Dear 
Harold," her hopes for the future, her dying 
message : — " Tell Harold that I love him," — 
and her last written words, '^ Somewhere, some- 
how, we shall meet again." " And she it was 
whom I saw in my vision, standing in this room, 
even where you stood when I entered, clad in 
your robes, wearing the same ornaments, bear- 
ing the same flowers, welcoming me with the 
same words of love, and joy, and trust." 

" Tell me no more ! " exclaimed Helen, 
springing to her feet with a glad, half-sup* 
pressed cry of ecstatic joy, while her eye was 



EARTH REVISITED, 251 

fixed before her with a strained look, as if she 
would pierce the space of heaven and behold 
its inmost mysteries. 

" I have seen it all. I know it all/' she 
murmured to herself as in a trance of joy. 
" Yes, it is true ! it must be true ! You are 
indeed ' dear Harold/ the lover of my dreams. 
Have you those letters ? " she suddenly, almost 
fiercely, turned upon me as she aroused from 
her trance-like ecstasy. " No, I need not ask. 
I have them ! " she exclaimed. " I will show 
them to you ; " and to my utter astonishment, 
she rushed from tlie room, leaving me alone in 
my amazement. 

I was not long left to my thoughts. In a 
moment she returned, bearing in her han'd a 
package of letters, which she placed in mine 
and whispered " Read." 

My pulses throbbed with strange emotions, 
as I saw spread out before me perfect copies of 
Theresa's letters. Even the dates and refer- 
ences to contemporaneous events were the 
same ; the handwriting and entire appearance 
of the letters were as if written by the same 
hand at the same time. I scarcely dared to 
read them. 

" Where did you get these ? " I asked, in 
awe-struck wonder. 

I wrote them myself," replied she, calmly. 
You wrote them ! Why, these are the 
very words and expressions of Theresa's letters 






2/)2 EAltill UKVI^irLI). 

— the tracings of a hand that has been a century 
in the tomb. How could you write them ? " 

"I do not know how it was done, but I 
know now that I wrote them. I will tell 
you all.^ You cannot know, dear Harold, how 
I loved you when we were first acquaint, ere 
the cloud of your alienation, as we called it, 
came between us." 

" Ah ! even now you use the very words 
Theresa penned," I interposed. 

" I cannot help doing so," she answered, 
solemnly. " You do not know how I hung 
over you in your illness and hoped for your 
recovery ; nor my great grief and disappoint- 
ment, that in your recovery you had forgotten 
me. But when I heard you call for Theresa, 
an arrow pierced my heart ; for I felt that 
another had divided your affection with me. 
For a short time we were happy again. But 
soon I saw that your heart was certainly 
estranged. I could conceive that your ideas of 
a former life were only the delusions of your 
illness, but I too plainly saw that I was not 
supreme in your affection. I felt that I must 
fly from you ; that if your love were true, you 
could not be happy without me." 

" Why, those are Theresa's own words again," 
I exclaimed. 

" Yes, Theresa's and mine," she calmly con- 
tinued. " At length I came to this secluded 
spot and sought to hide my sorrow and over- 



EARTH REVISITED. 25^ 

come my unrequited love. But in vain. You 
were ever in my thoughts ; your image was 
before my eyes, sleeping or waking. Most 
vividly in my dreams did I behold you and live 
with you a life of unalloyed love and joy. 
Strange scenes and events came to me in my 
visions, until I seemed to be another person and 
to live another life. One morning I found 
upon my table a letter. It was dated in the 
last century, but addressed to ' Dear Harold ' 
and full of the most tender love and trust, just 
such as I felt and would have penned to you. 
I could not conceive whence it came, for no 
one had access to my room. But I carefully 
preserved it and perused it. Soon another 
was found ; and another ; until nearly every 
morning I came to expect one of the mysterious 
missives upon my table. Still my strange 
dreams of you continued, and often, upon ris- 
ing, I could recall fragments of conversations 
and expressions, which I found repeated in the 
nightly letters. Then I knew that I must 
have written them myself. Unconsciously I 
had risen and penned my thoughts to you. 
They are the secret confessions of a maiden's 
heart, which only the truest, tenderest lover 
should ever know." 

She paused to steal a look of love at my 
wondering countenance, while I listened, speech- 
less with surprise, dumb with the apprehension 
of a mighty, most mysterious truth. 



254 EARTH BE VISITED, 

" Now that you have told me all, Harold/' 
she resumed, earnestly, " I believe you. I 
believe that your memory of a former state 
has been miraculously restored, and that in 
losing a quarter century out of the conscious- 
ness of your present existence, you have gained 
infinitely more in your wondrous recovery of 
a past life. I believe now that the affection 
which divided your heart with me was that of 
your former earth-love. But now it is wholly 
mine; though what may be the meaning of 
these mysterious letters, of my dreams, and of 
your vision, I dare not think. Can you tell 
me, dear Harold ? " she concluded in a whisper, 
to which her last words gradually sank, while 
her slight frame trembled as she clung more 
closely to me, hiding her white face and tear- 
dewed eyes upon my breast. 

A light, as of a new creation, suddenly 
burst upon me. A great exaltation and glad- 
ness possessed me, and a passion of love over- 
whelmed me, as I clasped the trembling, lovely 
creature to my heart and exclaimed : 

" Helen, my own and only love, do you not 
see ? Do you not know ? The voice, the dress, 
the words ; the thoughts, the heart, the soul, 
the very self : all are the same ! You are The- 
resa. My lost love lives. You are mine again ; 
mine forever. Unworthy as I am, I have been 
doubly blest. The irrevocable past has been 
restored. Death is overpast. Love is immor-

tal. Orpheus, searching through Hades, has 
found his Eurydice." 

The dear form in my arms trembled more 
violently as I thus unburdened my inmost soul 
and declared my glad conviction and my joy. 
Then gradually she became calmer, and I heard 
her softly sobbing. I was perfectly happy ; 
an ineffable peace and calmness filled my soul. 
As I reviewed my life — my two lives — I saw 
that all had been for the best. That only thus 
could I have realized my former failure, my 
suicidal self-seeking and my useless life. But 
the love and happiness of which I had been 
unworthy in one existence, had been vouchsafed 
me in another, and in a most wonderful manner. 
I could but tremble with joy as I traced the 
steps by which I had been led to this perfect 
consummation, and recalled the marvelous 
means of its accomplishment. I bent with rev- 
erent love to kiss the fair being in my arms ; 
when she raised her lovely head, and with 
bUssful peace and gladness beaming in her 
tear-dimmed eyes, she whispered : 

"I knew we had met and loved before. 
Such love as ours could not be confined to one 
short life. Did not I say that love at first sight 
is but the meeting of kindred souls who have 
known and loved in another sphere ? I have 
always felt so in regard to our love. I have 
always been as assured of my former existence 
as of a future one. But I had no remembrance 



256 EARTH BE VISITED. 

of it. I did not recognize you as my old life 
lover, though I felt that such an undying affec- 
tion could not grow up in the brief period of 
our late acquaintance. And what an experi- 
ence has been yours ! It was indeed Theresa 
on whom you called in the hour of your strange 
recovery. But I will be no more jealous of 
her, for she and I are one. Did not I say in 
that dim, far away day, that ^ somewhere, some- 
how, we should meet again ? ' And what a 
meeting ! Is not this heaven ? " 

A beatific brightness overspread her counte- 
nance as she spoke, while a gratitude too great 
for utterance filled my soul. 

^^ It is heaven enough for me," I answered. 
" Here are life, love and fraternity ; brother- 
hood, beneficence, and labor for the good of 
others ; self-sacrifice. Christian communism — 
the spirit of the Christ. What more can mor- 
tal man desire ? " 

" What ring is this on your hand ? " she 
suddenly asked. She had been unconsciously 
twisting it on my finger while I spoke. At 
first, I did not weigh her question, but as I let 
my eyes fall upon my hand and perceived the 
object of her inquiry, a light, gold band bearing 
a small diamond, upon my third finger, I could 
but give an involuntary exclamation of surprise. 

" Would you know its whole story, Helen, 
dear ? " 

" Yes, yes," she whispered, " tell me all." 

"That ring, my darling, was given to The- 



EAllTll UEVllSirKD, -257 

resa by me when we were first engaged. She 
wore it until she died. Then it was taken 
from her cold finger and sent to me. I wore 
it until my death, an ever-present souvenir of 
her pure, undying love. Then by my will, it 
was locked in my safe, with her letters and 
other precious tokens of our story. When I 
received the package of letters, I found again 
this ring among them. I instantly recognized 
it and with reverence I replaced it on my finger. 
It bears within, her initials and the date of its 
presentation. Do you wish to see it ? " 

" Wait ! do not remove it yet ! " she exclaimed, 
with an excited gesture. " Wait a moment ! 
I can tell you the inscription on the ring." 
And before I could utter my astonishment, she 
continued, " the initials within the ring are T. 
L. S. and the date is May 20, 1866." 

" You are correct," I replied ; " yet how 
could you know ? You surely have not seen 
the ring before ? " 

" Yes, the ring is mine," she responded sol- 
emnly. " You gave it to me more than a cen- 
tury ago. It was the seal of our betrothal. It 
is mine and I claim it now." 

" Most gladly will I replace it on your hand, 
dear Helen. This most precious token of our 
love, our recognition, and our indissoluble union, 
is yours forever." 

I placed the slender, golden circle on her fair 
finger, and sealed our new betrothal with a kiss,

Many and most blissful were the days that 
Helen and I passed in her beautiful home be- 
neath the tropics. Here we were wed. Yet no 
human ceremony could bind us closer than the 
love wliich had survived a century of separation. 
In the far-off time, Theresa and I had given 
ourselves to each other with pledges of eternal 
fealty, and though a maiden's love only had been 
hers, yet, in this renewed existence, we still felt 
that we had always been united and had spent 
a lifetime in the companionship of wedded love. 
Our honeymoon passed swiftly in a succession 
of cloudless days and moonlit nights such as 
come only in southern climes. We had so much 
to say, so many things to tell of our long, 
strange separation, and of our still more strange 
reunion, that it seemed the story could never all 
be told. Helen, indeed, had no history like 
mine to relate. Beyond the dim suggestions, 
dreams, and impressions which came to her and 
her strange knowledge of the letters and the 



EARTH REVISITED. 259 

ring, she knew nothing of her previous life. 
From the hour when Theresa closed her dark, 
far-seeing eyes to scenes of earth, until the hour 
of her revealing to herself, all was a blank. I 
had the whole hard history of a lifetime to re- 
late ; but her recollections of the beginnings of 
our recent love and of the lost quarter century 
of my present life were of great interest t^o me. 
My only knowledge of that period was derived 
from my sweet instructor who thus became in 
truth my " better half." She delighted to 
dwell upon those tender themes, but the story 
of my former state filled her with sympathy and 
sorrow. Said she, 

" I cannot think, dear Harold, without a shud- 
der, of your long, loveless struggling existence 
in the nineteenth century. You seem like a 
soul escaped from purgatory." 

" It was purgatory," I replied, with a sigh 
of recollection. 

We were sitting in the evening upon the 
broad veranda, overshadowed by the tall palms, 
through whose broad fronds the full moon shot 
its rising rays. The waters of the numerous 
lakes and canals reflected its silvery sheen, 
broken into myriad facets of effulgence by the 
swift-plying gondolas, from which came up the 
light laughter and gay song of youth and beauty. 
The tinkling bells of the slowly moving camels 
in the narrow streets fell upon our ears. But 
while the soft sound seemed to harmonize most

fitly with the peaceful scene, it could but re- 
mind me ot* the street cars of the nineteenth 
century, into which sweltering masses of hu- 
manity were patiently packed like cattle in a 
car. Yet, thought I, the horse car and the ele- 
vated railroad were great teachers of democracy. 
The rich and the poor met together and the 
conductor took toll of them all. They shared 
their common indignities, breathed in turn the 
infected air, and mutually imparted their dis- 
eases. The gentle injunctions " step lively," 
" crowd up there," were addressed with impar- 
tial authority to ladies and gentlemen, the hum- 
ble and the haughty. The long-suffering public, 
having thrown off the political yoke of foreign 
domination, immediately, like the stupid ox, 
placed its strong neck beneath the burden of 
new masters, of its own choosing, and patiently 
dragged the car of soulless corporations of its 
own creation. There came over me, like a night- 
mare, the remembrance of the hard, hopeless, 
selfish lives we had led ; rich and poor, monop- 
olist and socialist, all alike in pursuit of the 
" almighty dollar." I thought of the misery 
which might have been mitigated, the untold 
suffering of little children, doomed from the 
cradle to forsake their God-given innocence and 
to fight for the crusts of life with the strong 
tigers of the streets. I thought of those en- 
feebled by age and misfortune, who sank hope- 
lessly beneath the waves of the struggling sea 



EARTH REVISITED. 261 

of life, with but a sob and a gurgling groan, 
whose last days might so easily have been made 
their best days ; of the many fair sisters, who 
might have been a joy and blessing to them- 
selves and others, driven to an existence of sin 
and shame and unknown suffering, for lack of 
the touch of kindness and of human sympathy. 
I recalled the competitions of trade, in which 
the weaker went to the wall with as Uttle sym- 
pathy as in the days of feudaUsm. Each was 
for himself, even to the saving of his 'own soul. 
And I had lived in that world ! I had been one 
of its toiling, struggling millions, seeking noth- 
ing, thinking of nothing, but my own success 
and advancement, my own family and their 
material comfort, my own church and the ex- 
tension of its influence, my own salvation and 
the possession of a mansion on one of the most 
exclusive and fashionable streets of the New 
Jerusalem. Yet, through such experiences and 
discipline, is humanity by slow gradations raised 
above the level of its brute inheritance and 
purified from its innate animalism. Self pres- 
ervation may be the first law of nature, but it 
is not the law of God. 

Helen's last words still lingered in my ears, 
mingled with the sound of the tinkling bells 
which had called me so far away from my 
present surroundings. 

" I am indeed a soul which has passed 
through purgatory," I continued, arousing 



262 EAliTII REVISITED. 

from my reverie. " My life, all life, is a disci- 
pline, an expiation, a preparation for a higher 
and better state, either in this world or some 
other. 

" ' Heaven is not reached at a single bound; 

But we build tlie ladder by which we rise 
From the lowly earth to the vaulted skies, 
And we mount to its summit round by round.* 

" ' Over the wrecks of our dead selves, we rise 
to higher things.' " 

" But now purgatory is past," rejoined Helen. 
" We are reunited, no more to part. Death 
cannot sever us again. You will find in this 
new time greatly changed conditions. The 
application of the single principle of love for 
thy neighbor, or altruism as it was called, has 
revolutionized society. The practice of true, 
Christian socialism, in place of sacerdotalism, has 
introduced vital religion and made it an active 
element in human life and conduct. You will 
be far happier now, and in service to others, 
you will find a satisfaction that your self-seek- 
ing age never dreamed of. Here in this em- 
bowered refuge, amid the birds and flowers, the 
babbling brooks and flowing fountains, we can- 
not long remain. We must go forth hand in 
hand, strengthened by our mutual affection, for 
a life of loving labor." 

" I would gladly remain in this paradise for- 
ever," I replied, " but I will go wherever you 



EARTH REVISITED. 263 

may lead. I do not yet know how I found you 
here. I had no knowledge of your dwelling 
place. Another directed me to your door. 
Were you not surprised to see me ? " 

" Not in the least. When my strong desire 
and will united to bring you hither, it was done. 
I sent my heart out after you, across the waters, 
to lead you hither. I stood expecting you, 
when you appeared at my door." 

" But you do not know the guide that directed 
my course ? It was Irene Merivale. There is 
something mysterious about that girl. She it 
was who told me that my love awaited me. 
She guided the swift anemon to your door, then 
calling herself my good angel, as indeed she 
was, she rose and disappeared." 

" Ah ! was it Irene ? I know her well. 
Tell me more about her ? " Helen responded 
quickly. 

" I will tell you all I know," I answered, hop- 
ing to solve the enigma ctf Irene's strange con^ 
duct. " One evening, a short time previous to 
my departure, she appeared suddenly and un- 
bidden in my room. Love, tender and true, 
beamed in every feature, spoke in every word 
and gesture. But most strangely, she seemed 
to have your voice, your words, your very ex- 
pression, most unlike herself as I knew her. 
But as suddenly as she came, she changed and 
vanished. I could have declared that you, 
dear Helen, had been with me ; your presence 



-04 EARTH REVISITED. 

and influence were so near and so pervading. 
I had been thinking of you, lovingly longing 
for your presence ; but I knew not where you 
were in the wide world. Where were you at 
that hour, my dearest ? " 

" I was with you, Harold," She whispered 
softly. " At that hour, in one of my day- 
dreams, I beheld you. Love had overcome my 
pride, and I had ceased to struggle against it. 
Mv heart went out to vou in intense longdnor to 
see you and be with you; when suddenly, as 
through an open door, I beheld you. You 
were sitting in your room in a large old-fashioned 
arm-chair, your head bowed upon your hand, 
your table spread with letters — my letters — ^and 
the h^jht burning dimly beside you. I crept 
softly up behind you, as when I first met you 
in my father's room, placed my hand in yours, 
imprinted a kiss upon your cheek, and then as 
you arose, the vision vanished. I saw you no 
more, but I knew that I had beheld you and 
been with vou." 

^* It is true," I exclaimed, astonished. ^^ It 
is true in everv detail. But the form that 
came to me was that of Irene Merivale. It was 
not Helen Newcome. Are vou and Irene one ? ' ' 

" Ah, no indeed ; I hope you did not think 
so," she answered with a smile. *' Irene was a 
wild creature. Her father was a strange man. 
He was devoted to psychical investigation and 
research an'l. it was said, experimented upon 



EARTH REVISITED. 265 

his own daughter until her mind lost its self- 
control. He often came to consult my father, 
and Irene came with him. At such times she 
would do and say the most strange and unex- 
pected things, apparently unconsciously, which 
her father said were caused by his mere voli- 
tion. ' He also declared that I possessed unsus- 
pected powers of hypnotism, and urged me to 
develop them. But I refused. However, 
Irene seemed to have an irresistible attraction 
towards me, and would follow me about all 
day obedient to my slightest wish, even more 
closely and less consciously than my dog. 
When her father died, she seemed lost without 
him, and unable to direct her own actions. 
Her own mother was an utter stranger to her. 
But when she was with me, she seemed to be 
perfectly happy and obedient to my will. She 
would interpret my slightest wish, even before 
it was uttered. Indeed, she often seemed to 
know and do my will when I was absent from 
her. I appeared to impress my thoughts upon 
her by a sort of mental telegraphy or telepathy. 
I see now the cause of her strange appearance to 
you. My strong desire and will to see you, in 
my day dream, made Irene the unconscious 
medium of my thought. I drew Irene to you, 
inspired her with my feelings, invested her even 
with my looks. I was Avith you in the spirit, 
though it was Irene's hand that touched you." 
" And did you thus also instruct her how to 



2G6 EA R TU REVISITED. 

guide the anemon through the ocean spaces, to 
this far off continent, this inland island of peace 
and beauty ? " 

" Indeed, it must have been so. Again most 
strongly did my mind go after you, and follow 
you in all your flight over the sea and over the 
land, even to my dwelling. Until that time I 
had not wished to see you. I had striven to 
control my passion. But then I had ceased to 
resist it. I felt that you were mine, wholly 
mine, and that you must come to me and search 
for me, even to the uttermost parts of the 
earth ; and you obeyed. Do you not know that 
love has wings? " 

" Ah, what mighty pinions has science lent 
him in this new century ! Without them I 
should have failed to find you. You were in 
reality my guiding migel — as you will ever be," 
I added with a kiss, " though Irene's was the 
hand that led me. Now, I begin to understand 
her, for I have read her father's confession, 
telling all you suspected and much more. We 
do not know the debt we owe her, for without 
her mysterious power, I should not have seen 
you in my vision, and known you as you are, 
the idol of my soul, the love of my double life. 
It was the revealing of Theresa, as I beheld 
her, here in your room, weeping by her piano, 
that furnished the clue, which led to the inter- 
pretation of your dreams, and all the unrec- 
ognized indications of your identity." 



EARTH BE VISITED, 267 

I then related to Helen the story of the 
musical stones, cf the lost fifth, of Irene's un- 
conscious acts, and how, while wTapped in sleep, 
iier hand became the link by which the thought 
currents were conducted to my mind, the dis- 
t:int scene was made visible, and love was 
enabled to leap the barriers of time and space 
and overpass the grave. 

Helen answered only with a stronger press- 
ure of mv hand and a more radiant look of 
joy, while I could but clasp her closer in the 
arms of everlastinof love. Long: we sat thus in 
silence, ^4ewing the shifting shadows amid the 
moving leaves, and the delusive lights that 
danced upon the flowing stream and glancing 
waves; listening to the uncertain sound of dis- 
tant voices, and the dying ripple of falling 
waters, while the round-faced moon began to 
wane and lose its perfectness, the planets 
wheeled them to their setting, and even the 
fixed stars twinkled in the shimmering air and 
changed their place in heaven. Then hand in 
hand, w^e went within, shut out the world, 
removed its disguises, and were alone with 
love. " For whether there be tongues, they 
shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it 
shall pass away. But now abideth faith, hope, 
love, and the greatest of these is love.*' 

A few days later we returned to Brooklyn. 
Mr. Newcome was delighted to see us, but not 
greatly surprised at our return together. Even 



268 EAliTII REVISITED, 

when we informed him that we were marriel^ 
he seemed to be expecting that information ; 
perhaps he read it in our happy faces. At all 
events, he welcomed us to his home, and 
assured me of his pleasant anticipation of my 
companionship and assistance in his experi- 
ments. Even Charlie told his joyful greeting, 
not only in unmistakable dog language, but in 
the clearer tones of his strange speech. Helen 
immediately resumed her place as mistress of 
her father's house, and my new home. Queen 
of love and beauty, she reigned in both our 
hearts, while her wise ministration and bright 
smiles brought peace and gladness to all with- 
in her realm. 

Not long after our return, I visited my room 
at Mrs. Merivale's and found the precious 
letters and other tokens of my former life. 
Helen accompanied me to the room in which I 
had received her thought messages, and beheld 
the bright visions that restored my buried 
love. 

On a calm afternoon that will be forever 
graven on our memories, we together read those 
tokens of our former life. With hushed voice.s 
and reverent touch, we unfolded the lowj; 
closed pages and reviewed the old, old story. It 
was all as yesterday to me. I lived again those 
days of my youthful love mth mingled joy and 
pain, and with a bursting heart, all the old love 
welled up and overflowed to Helen. The 



EABTH REVISITED. 2G9 

author of those precious epistles was beside me. 
I could indeed scarcely realize that she was in 
truth the same ; that I had found my long-lost 
love at last. Helen, too, with palpitating 
bosom read the words that told her love of a 
century before. With frequent exclamations 
of surprise and recognition of long forgotten 
scenes and experiences, she lived again the 
thoughts and feelings so familiar to her heart. 
'* They are indeed mine, mine ! " she murmured, 
" we have met again." Then she solemnly 
refolded the letters and returned them to their 
casket. It was hke beholding again the face 
of the long departed dead. Then I showed 
her Theresa's photograph. Long and intensely 
she gazed upon it. " Sweet girl," she whis- 
pered, as she kissed it. " So young, so fair, 
so good ; and yet how sad was her short life. 
I see the lines of pain and suffering in those 
compressed lips, calm resignation and unfalter- 
ing faith in the broad, smooth brow and angelic 
virtue in those deep, unflinching eyes that 
might look on God." 

" But do you not see a resemblance to your- 
self ?" I asked. 

*^ Yes, I perceive it, though she had darker 
hair and eyes than mine and a sad expression 
in their depths that shows she had felt and 
suffered more than I." 

At these words all the memory of my mis- 
doings surged over me, and I felt as one who 



270 EARTH REVISITED, 

disembodied first beholds the awful eyes of the 
Pure and Holy fixed upon his naked soul. I 
knelt beside her and besought forgiveness. 
" God forbid," I cried, " that I should bring to 
you again, the suffering that my selfish heart 
once caused. All my life shall be an expia- 
tion for my sin, though the past, alas ! can 
never be recalled, or its deeds undone ; I can 
only strive to make the future brighter as it 
stands revealed against the awful shadows of 
the past." 

" I have nothing to forgive, dear Harold," 
whispered Helen, " and were the wrong a thou- 
sand times as great, it is forgiven ere it is done. 
Love does not wait to be entreated ; nor does 
God." 

" Whose portrait is this ? " she asked, taking 
up another photograph of a fair young maiden, 
that was included among my treasures. 

" That is the portrait of my daughter, The- 
resa, the namesake of my first love. A sweeter, 
purer, and more loving being never drew breath. 
Hers, too, was a sad story ; but at the time 
when that portrait was taken she had never 
known a sorrow or a care." 

" That is plainly seen in her smooth, oval 
face, in her clear, bright eyes and smiling lips. 
But do you not see a strong resemblance to the 
first Theresa ? The features are very similar 
and the same pure soul looks out of the deep, 
dark eyes. Can it be that she — that I — visited 



EA li Til BE VI SITED. 271 

you again in that fair form ? that the pure 
affection of a daughter's heart was lavished 
upon you to win you from the ways of selfish- 
ness and strife, and to recall her pristine purity 
and love ? " 

" I do not know," I murmured. " It may 
have been. Much as I loved her, I did not 
truly value her affection till it was too late. 
Each birth is an incarnation of the love of God ; 
childhood bears His signet on its brow." 

With bowed head and with tender heart, I 
placed these tokens of the past again in my 
safe. Then I turned the key upon them and 
addressed myself to the present. " Now, let 
us go," I said. 

As we turned to depart from Mrs. Merivale's, 
a door opened and Irene entered. She greeted 
Helen warmly as an old friend, welcoming her 
back to Brooklyn in a most self-possessed man- 
ner, and turned to me. Without a trace of 
embarrassment, she expressed her pleasure at 
my return and congratulated me upon my suc- 
cess in finding Helen and my good fortune in 
being now united to her. This was a new rev- 
elation to me. Here was another Irene. She 
was no more the birdlike, unthinking being 
that I knew, singing and flitting about the 
house in idle joy, nor the impressible, uncon- 
scious instrument of unseen and unapprehended 
forces. Nor was she the strange, silent, mys- 
terious guide of my recent journey, but a calm. 



272 EAlirn REVISITED. 

self-poised, intelligent woman. I was more 
surprised at this transformation than at any 
other. 

" I have you to thank, Miss Merivale," I 
responded, " for my great good fortune. Not 
only did you lead me to my distant love and 
teach me how to win her, but you, in some mys- 
terious manner which I cannot understand, 
have enabled me to find my heart's desire, and 
showed Helen to herself, uniting hearts long 
severed, across the wastes of years. You have 
indeed proved to be my good angel, as you 
called yourself, when I last saw you disappear- 
ing in the sky." 

" I am delighted to see you thus, Irene," ex- 
claimed Helen, giving her another sisterly kiss. 
" You are indeed another Irene. You no 
longer need my guidance or move responsive 
to another's will. Pray tell us how all this has 
come about ? " 

" I fear you would not understand," replied 
she. " I scarcely comprehend myself, even yet. 
What I may have been or done in the past, I 
surely am not responsible for. It was not I 
that lived and moved in my person. Another 
power seemed at times to possess me and strange 
impulses seized me which I could not resist or 
understand or scarce remember afterwards. 
Now I am free ; but I have scarcely obtained 
full control of my faculties. Your husband 
has doubtless beheld some strange manifesta- 



EARTH REVISITED. 273 

tions on my part, but I trust he will pardon me 
and forget them/' 

" There is no occasion for me to do either, 
I assure you. I shall ever remember you with 
the deepest wonder and sincerest gratitude. 
But who has broken the mysterious spell of 
your former life ? Can you tell us that? " 

"My father," answered Irene earnestly. 

I gazed upon her with Avonder at this an- 
nouncement, for I knew that it was his influence 
that, in the beginning at least, had bound her 
with its invisible chain. 

"I have read his statement," she continued. 
" I know all that he related then and much 
more. I have seen him." 

At these words, both Helen and I could but 
start with amazement and express our surprise 
and incredulity. But Irene continued, unheed- 
ing our exclamations : 

" Four weeks ago to-day, I saw my father, 
here in this room, standing where you now 
stand, in the broad light of day, at this very 
hour. I not only saw him, but I conversed 
with him for nearly an hour, and it was that 
interview and the disclosures he then made that 
have wrought the change which you now see 
in me. 

We could only listen in rapt attention to 
Irene's strange story. She continued : 

" After reading my father's confession, as he 

called it, I was at first more bewildered than 
18 



274 EA R TH REVISITED. 

before. I could not realize that I had thus 
been the subject of another's power, and still 
less that such an influence could extend beyond 
the grave. I remembered my father well, for 
he has been dead but three years. He was a 
strong intellectual man Avhom I regarded with 
more fear than love, though my mother wor- 
shiped him. But there w^as never anything 
in common between her and me. I can almost 
believe that I am not her offspring. But my 
father's mind and mine were as one. My 
greatest delight when a child was to sit beside 
him and hear him play upon the musical stones. 
After he was gone, I had a strong desire to 
hear them, but I knew not how to touch them 
nor where to find the lost fifth. Afterwards I 
often dreamed of hearing them, but it was only 
when awakened by you on that eventful even- 
ing that I realized that I was the unconscious 
musician. Then I resolved to resist the unseen 
influence and assert my individuality. I se- 
curely locked my father's cabinet and removed 
the key. The midnight music was heard no 
more, though more than once I found myself 
wandering in my sleep in search of the lost key. 
But gradually my wanderings ceased and I be- 
came more confident of myself. 

" One afternoon, not many days after read- 
ing my father's manuscript, I sat in this room, 
in his old easy chair, musing a maiden's idle day- 
dream, thinlang of nothing in particular, when 



EA R Til REVISITED. 275 

a light shadow appeared between me and the 
window. Looking up I saw my father stand- 
ing before me. I was not terrified nor greatly 
surprised. He was clad as usual when attend- 
ing patients, and seemed to have just returned 
to his office from a professional visit. He 
looked upon me with his keen gray eye that 
always seemed to look right through me and 
motioned me to rise. I did so and he slowly 
seated himself in the easy chair. I stood be- 
side him as of old without fear or questioning, 
as if he were in life. Indeed the fact that he 
had long been numbered among the dead did 
not impress me at the time." 

" I do not comprehend the unreasoning 
terror with which many regard the dead," I 
interposed. " Even the appearances of those 
most loved usually bring but dread and desire 
for their disappearance. It must be a survival 
of the instincts of our barbarian, semi-simian 
ancestry, like the fear of serpents. Perhaps if 
the ghosts had received a more cordial welcome 
upon their revisiting ^ the pale glimpses of the 
mOon' their visits would not have been so few 
and far between." 

"My father was not a ghost," declared 
Irene emphatically. " I saw him as certainly 
as I ever beheld him in life. He is alive, as 
truly as you are. He sat there, in that chair, 
that afternoon and talked with me as easily 
and naturally as he ever did," 



276 EARTH REVISITED. 

" And what did he say ? " we asked eagerly. 

" I cannot recall all his words, nor the exact 
language of his discourse/' replied Irene, " but 
I remember well the substance of his words. 
' Irene/ he said, in calm, clear tones, ^ my dear 
daughter, can you forgive your father ? ' ^ I 
have forgiven already all that was to be for- 
given,' I answered. ' I do not blame you for 
what you have done. I understand your in- 
tense desire to extend the limits of human 
knowledge.' ' And I have done so, have I 
not ? ' he continued in more cheerful manner. 
^ I have not lived in vain. I have demonstrated 
that the mind, the pure thought of man, can 
extend itself through the invisible ether which 
is the substance of the universe and impinge 
itself upon otlier minds. So much psychical 
research has already established. And now, 
my dear, that I am assured of your forgiveness 
for the evil that I unintentionally have done, 
and that the wrong is already partially repaired, 
I shall be happier. I shall seek to guide or 
control your steps no more. Assert your own 
will-power and no other can gain the mastery 
over you. Give not way to sudden and un- 
reasoning impulse. Be not the creature of 
conditions. Let not the air, the climate, the 
food you eat, the friends you meet, the inci- 
dents that occur about you, rule your conduct. 
Be master of circumstances. Success depends 
upon having a programme. Make your own 



EARTH liEVISlTED. 211 

plan of life and pursue it to the end. Thus 
will you develop your own energies and intel- 
lect, and become all that you can be in this life 
and be best fitted to enter upon another and a 
higher stage of existerioe.' As he paused a 
light of fatherly affection beamed in his eye 
and aroused an answering warmth of love in 
me. I stretched forth my arms to him, but 
they met only the obstruction of the chair in 
which he sat. I started back amazed, but he 
only gazed upon me calmly, lovingly as before. 
The strange thought that I was conversing with 
the dead now for the first time occurred to me. 

" ' Father,' I exclaimed. ' Dear father, who 
are you ? Where are you ? ' 

" * I am here, my child, as you see. Why 
do you ask ? ' 

" ' But are you not dead ? Can the dead 
walk and talk as you do? ' 

" ' My dear daughter, there are no dead. 
This is but another form of e^stence. We 
are the same. What would I not have given 
to know this fact in my former state ! What 
a strength and reinforcement of man's mortal 
powers and activities this assurance gives ! 
Men would work all the more earnestly while 
the day lasts, knowing that all the good ac- 
complished, all the virtue attained, all the evil 
overcome, is but the vantage-ground from 
which they step into a higher life. It is only 
a thin veil that separates us. But, ! what 



278 EARTH REVISITED. 

a light from the hither side shines back upon 
the other life ! Could men but for a moment 
see all their vain strivings and imaginings, 
their cruel selfishness and worse than brutal 
conduct to each other, in its true light, then 
would they make life worth living and their 
hereafter would be far happier than now. 
Farewell, my child ; I go not far away. We 
are all about you. This is the real life. You 
see but the appearances of things. The de- 
parted do not die.' 

" As he ceased speaking, the rays of the 
setting sun shot into the windows and illumined 
his form with a faint halo of glory. Then, as 
it slowly descended and disappeared, his form 
seemed to vanish with it, and where he sat, at 
length I beheld nothing but the old arm-chair 
and the familiar objects in the room." 

As Irene ceased speaking, we stood in silence, 
finding no terms with which to express our 
wonder or the thoughts suggested by her 
words. 

" Do you now doubt that I have seen my 
father ? " she exclaimed. " I am assured of it 
as certainly as that I now see you. I was not 
dreaming. And if I had been, I could not 
have conceived the thoughts that he expressed 
to me." 

" They are certainly very suggestive," I 
could but confess, " and well worth the con- 
sideration of all qandid men. They are an 



EARTU HE VISITED. 279 

inspiration to me. I know their truth from my 
own sad experience." 

" Let us try to forget that," whispered Helen, 
drawing me away. 

" Ah ! if we only could forget ! " I sighed. 
'^ But everywhere and always we must drag the 
body of the being we once were." 

" Come ! " she softly whispered. " The 
present is ours. Its duties call us. ^ Soon the 
night Cometh when no man can work.' " 

We returned to our homes with humble, 
happy hearts, and addressed ourselves to the 
work before us. Helen aided and inspired me 
in my new labors with wonderful sympathy and 
skill. The wife of the twentieth century was 
not merely man's complement, the sharer of his 
domestic ties and partner of his lighter toils, 
but a participant in all his efforts, an organizer 
and guide in all his plans and leader in all un- 
dertakings for the refinement of existence. As 
man's main occupation had ceased to be war, 
actual or industrial, and brain instead of brute 
strenoi:h had become the chief factor in ma- 
terial and moral progress, woman had risen to 
her equal station, a God-given help-meet for 
man. 

Helen keenly perceived the difficulties of my 
position, the prejudices, fears and phantoms of 
the past that still environed me. With wise 
affection and with loving tact, she sought by 
every method to dispel these brooding supersti- 



280 EARTH REVISITED. 

tions and strengthen my heart with trust and 
hope, not born of vain imaginations and desires, 
but based upon the firm foundations of the 
facts of life and truths of science. 

I became greatly interested in her work, 
and in her father's efforts. These were mainly 
directed toward improving the moral condition 
and surroundings of the young. " Rescue 
work must constantly be repeated," declared 
Mr. Newcome ; " but all work done in the line 
of prevention, by training the young, bears fruit 
a hundred-fold. Let the drunkards die and the 
paupers perish ; rescue the infants ; train the 
children. In this way the world can be regen- 
erated in a century." 



XYII. 



There were in Mr. Newcome's discourse 
many things not quite clear to me. I fre- 
quently failed to grasp the whole import of his 
words at the moment, but in reflecting upon 
them afterwards, I was able to comprehend 
them more fully. At the same time many 
questions arose to which I desired an answer in 
order to complete the connection of ideas in my 
mind and to understand the new attitude of 
men toward each other and toward God. 

In a former interview, he had shown me an 



EAllTII REVISITED. 281 

example of what he called " Applied Christi- 
anity ; " but I wished to learn further of the 
application of these principles to the world in 
general. " Is this a universal religion ? " I 
asked him one day, soon after I had become 
settled in my new home. " This is God's 
world/' he answered earnestly. '^ ^ While the 
Christian theorist insists that selfishness is in- 
eradicable, the movement of society is tending 
to ^a point where altruism must be accepted 
as a scientific necessity. There is no indivi- 
dual health, except in the health of the com- 
munity.' " 

" I recall," I added, " an illustration in my 
day of these statements. In the report of the 
surgeon-general of the United States for the 
year 1890, he says : ' The United States would 
be the gainer, even in a pecuniary sense, if it 
were to give the Cuban government sufficient 
funds to make Havana a healthy seaport. Yel- 
low fever is almost always present in Havana 
and Rio de Janeiro, and they are a standing 
menace to the health of the United States.' 
The cholera makes all men kin." 

" That lesson has at length been learned and 
taken to heart," responded Mr. Newcome with 
a smile. " Commerce and common advantage 
have drawn the peoples together. There are 
now but two nations on two continents ; the 
United States of America, and the United 
States of Europe. When the influence of 



282 EA R Til REVISITED. 

religion, instead of keeping men apart, was 
added to that of society, science and self-inter- 
est drawing them togetlier, they flew to each 
other like the armature to the magnet, and 
were welded into one in the fires of reciprocal 
benefit and beneficence. When the Christian 
treated the Jew upon Christian principles, it 
was found that they were at heart one* 
When the Christian sects became united they 
naturally drew other religions to them, when, 
to their mutual surprise, it was found tTiat 
there was, and always had been, but one religion 
in the world — ^love to God and love to man." 

" And what became of the standing armies ? " 
I asked, astonished. 

" They were disbanded when men refused 
longer to fight each other. The white squadrons 
are used only to signalize the victories of peace. 
The appeals of kings and chancellors to national 
pride and narrow patriotism, to imaginary 
altars and fatherland, to race and religious 
prejudice, fell upon dull ears which heard daily 
of the peace and prosperity of their brethren 
in America, where the torch of liberty blazed 
beside the palaces of peace. The trade of 
king is obsolete. Aristocrats took on their true 
shape at the touch of Ithuriel's spear, — the 
newspaper." 

^' And what is the present form of govern- 
ment ? " I asked eagerly. 

"Democracy is now triumphant everywhere. 



EARTH REVISITED. 283 

The governments of the earth are administered 
by the people, for the people. Yet we do not 
employ the national power to reduce all to a 
dead level of dependence, but to protect all in 
their innate rights and to foster the spirit of 
self-improvement and mutual helpfulness. A 
truly paternal administration does not desu^e its 
children to remain in a condition of helpless 
infancy, but to develop into stalwart and 
honorable independence. Nationalism is un- 
natural." 

" But how has democracy become thus pre- 
valent in one century ? " I asked. 

" All that you have seen," he went on : " the 
changes in society, industry, religion and gov- 
ernment, are but the outcome of applied 
Christianity. To the true Christian, all men 
are equal. But what crimes have been com-, 
mitted in the name of religion ! Its history 
has been but a record of wrong and conflict 
between classes and creeds." 

" ' As long as God is felt to be everywhere 
in his world as he made it,' says the author of 
God in His World, ^ He is not sought elsewhere 
in a world of man's imagining. When man 
sets up for himself, he builds not only a palace 
of art, but a magnificent temple of faith, which 
in every part of the structure is a denial of 
God and Nature, and which he devotes to the 
supernatural.' ' The groves were God's first 
temples.' ' There our Aryan ancestor chanted 



284 EARTH REVISITED. 

his Vedic hymn about the family altar at sun- 
rise, offering not a sacrifice but a feast/ 

" But this simple form of worship was soon 
succeeded by the system of Brahminism, with 
the introduction of caste. The sacred mys- 
teries supplanted Nature worship. An exclu- 
sive priesthood intervened between man and 
his Maker. Royalty and priesthood united to 
enslave the people. The love of God was 
changed to fear, human fellowship to suspicion, 
and religious worship to mystery. Here the 
idea of mediation originated ; the priest became 
a mediator. The primitive purity of the wor- 
ship of the patriarchs, of Abraham, of Job and 
Melchisedek, was corrupted by the complex 
sacerdotal system introduced from Egypt. In- 
stead of Abraham entertaining in his wide- 
leaved tent the messengers of God, we see the 
sons of Levi guarding a closed tabernacle, and a 
succession of priests butchering bullocks in the 
temple courts. The simple religion of the 
people and the sublime Theism of the prophets 
were both superseded by the ceremonial sys- 
tem of the priests. 

" Jesus of Nazareth, a man of the people, 
' approved of God,' cast himself against the 
priestly clan — and they slew him. But those 
who knew him loved him, and after his death 
banded themselves together in Christian com- 
munity to do his work and spread his word. 
But they could not escape the influence of 



EARTH REVISITED. 285 

Jewish priestcraft and Greek philosophy. The 
one introduced the idea of atonement through 
sacrifice, converting Jesus himself inta a priest, 
removing the ' Friend of sinners ' far from 
human fellowship and abandoning his ways and 
works for forms and ceremonies. From the 
subtleties of Greek philosophy sprang the doc- 
trines and creeds which have been the source 
of endless contention ever since men began to 
confound piety with theology, and theology 
with metaphysics." 

" But was not Christianity a religion for the 
people ?" I interposed. 

" In the early centuries of Christianity, for 
the first time in history, the poor had the gos- 
pel of good- will and fraternity," he replied. 
"But the terrible persecutions to which they 
were subjected, caused them to look to a future 
life for deliverance and peace and to regard 
the present with contempt. Again priests 
were prompt to take advantage of this feeling 
and to reinforce it with all the aids of imagina- 
tion in picturing the rewards of the pious and 
the punishments of the impenitent. It was easy 
to be profuse in promises of bliss in a world 
to come, and to describe the horrors of a hell 
hereafter. They could draw ad libitum upon 
the bank of the future. 

" When Christianity rose from the Catacombs 
to the throne of Rome, its pure spirit vanished. 
Again the people were reduced to a life of 



286 EARTH REVISITED. 

servitude and superstition, alleviated only by 
gleams of hope of a better world to come, 
casually emitted through the closed doors of 
Paradise to which the Church held the keys. 
Royalty and religion have gone hand in hand 
for their mutual advantage. God was repre- 
sented as a universal despot against whom man 
was by nature in rebellion. ' Roman theology 
made God an imperial Csesar and the Bible the 
statute-book of his laws.' Protestantism simply 
substituted an infallible book for an infallible 
church. The doctrine of election set up an 
aristocracy more arbitrary than any ever insti- 
tuted by king or pOpe. But all aristocracies 
are abolished now," he concluded. 

" Human society," I observed, " seems to 
have been built like the pyramids of Egypt, 
constructed under the lash by the people, as 
tombs and memorials of their oppressors ; broad 
at the base, narrowing in successive gradations 
to the apex, each resting with crushing weight 
upon the lower strata into which was compressed 
the sighs and tears of the toiling millions." 

" But the people have come to their own at 
last," he added, with animation. " God has 
always and everywhere been in his world. He 
would not abandon man, though man would 
abandon God. In savage and in serf, his image 
is stamped, his voice speaks. All the works of 
nature tell of his beneficence and love. God 
and man have not quarreled. Kings and 



EARTH REVISITED, 287 

priests could not separate the lovers. Creeds 
and councils could not conceal the truth. The 
face of the Father, once made manifest in im- 
maculate loveliness in the Son, could never be 
forgotten or disguised. Through all the wrong 
and wretchedness of barbarism ; the crimes and 
competitions of civilization ; in the childlike 
faith of the Aryans ; in the self-devotion of 
Budda ; in the moral precepts of Confucius ; 
in the sublime judgments of Osiris; in the 
Eleusinian mysteries ; in the Hebrew decalogue ; 
in their years of jubilee with release from debt, 
from slavery, and with rest for the soil ; in the 
warnings of the prophets ; in the divine-human 
life of Jesus of Nazareth ; in the lives and 
deaths of millions of his faithful followers ; in 
modern industry and invention ; in co-opera- 
tion and Christian communism, the Spirit of 
God has been at work leavening the mass, 
training men by sorrow and by death, by hope 
and fear, by sin and suffering, to apprehend 
his nearness and benevolence ; enforcing the 
fact of the fatherhood of God and the brother- 
hood of man." 

" Is not this a beautiful religion ? " whis- 
pered Helen, who had listened intently, divid- 
ing her glances of affection impartially between 
us. 

" Do you still believe in the Bible ? " I 
responded, recalling how it had been made the 
corner-stone of all the creeds. 



Si88 EARTH HE VISITED. 

" The life and death, the words and works 
of Jesus of Nazareth," replied Helen, frankly, 
" are as well attested as the hfe and death, the 
wars and writings of Julius Caesar. But there 
is no supernatural revelation. The Bible was 
made for man ; not man for the Bible. The 
test of its truth and divinity is in its adaptation 
to human needs and human nature. What- 
ever its origin, it is here now. We take it for 
what it is. We judge it as we do any other 
book — by its influence. Yet one fact is evident. 
Composed through many centuries, by many 
hands, its various writings are strung on the 
golden cord of a single thought. It shows 
man's course through the world from Paradise 
Lost to Paradise Regained ; not in a translation 
to another world, but in a new city erected on 
the earth wherein shall dwell the just and pure. 
Bring the precepts of the Bible to the scale 
of conscience. Compare them with the moral 
nature of man. Evidently they agree. Ap- 
parently their author is the same. It gives 
us a reUgion to live by. It is not a ^book 
of the dead.' But the chief end of man is 
not to glorify God. The chief end of God is 
to glorify man. This world is not a ' vale of 
tears,' except as man makes his own miseries. 

I have recently read an instructive parable, 
that I found in an ancient volume, which I 
would like to read to you," she added, chang- 
ing the topic. 



EARTH BE VISITED. 289 

"Anything from your lips will be sweet/' I 
answered. I half imagined she had written 
the story herself, but I listened with deep 
interest, while her silvery tones rehearsed the 
story of Ben Adhem. 

" A certain man, Ben Adhem by name, a 

dweller in Mesopotamia, for an offense against 

his sovereign, was condemned to death, and 

cast into prison, pending the execution of his 

sentence. Here he was allowed a certain 

degree of liberty, while, at the same time, the 

day and manner of his execution were kept a 

secret from him. He was allowed to go about 

the prison-grounds and occupy himself as he 

pleased, and also to have the society of his 

family and friends. In addition, there were 

others of his tribe who, for the same offense, 

were condemned to the same punishment and 

cast into the same prison. Here he had the 

consolation of their companionship, while each 

awaited his death in ignorance of the time and 

manner of his taking off. One by one they 

were secretly summoned and removed, but no 

two in precisely the same manner. No one knew 

when his day or hour would come. When he 

lay down at night, he knew not that he would 

behold the morning sun and when he arose he 

said to himself^ ' perchance this is the day of 

my death.' Ben Adhem's pleasure in the 

society of his loving wife and pretty children 

was embittered by the thought, that at any 
19 



290 EARTH REVISITED. 

moment, he might be called to leave them foi&gt; 
ever. To add to his distress, they also were 
under the same condemnation as himself. An 
act of attainder had passed upon all his 
descendants who were thereby doomed to- the 
same destiny. But his prattling babes were 
happy in ignorance of their fate, and when 
called, passed unconsciously to their death, 
while the agonized parents looked on powerless 
to prevent it, knowing only that soon their turn 
would come to follow them. 

" Ben Adhem, under these circumstances, 
could but feel a constant anxiety, not only as to 
the time and manner of his removal, but also as 
to his wife and children. At every stroke of the 
prison bell, he would start in alarm and gaze 
upon his little brood with deep apprehension, 
until the signal ceased to sound. At every 
change in their appearance, he fancied he per- 
ceived the sign of the dreaded hour. With 
every incident affecting himself or his surround- 
ings, he thought ' this may be the beginning 
of the end.' Fire and water, sword and shot, 
heat and cold, every force of nature and of 
man were arrayed against him, banded together 
to insure his destruction. Escape was impos- 
sible. Still, as his doom was delayed, he and 
his companions came to accept their situation 
with considerable composure. 

" None could forget their fearful peril for a 
moment^ but their methods of occupying their 



KARTU HE VISITED. 291 

time were as various as their dispositions. 
Some blindly refused to realize their situation 
and. engaged in feasting and riot, thereby 
hoping to drown the impending fact of their 
destruction in brutish indulgence. But it was 
the feast of Damocles, with the sword hanging 
over them. In the midst of their festivities it 
fell and they were snatched from the scenes of 
their self-indulgence. But their companions 
continued their careless revelry unconcerned, 
singing ' here's a toast to the next that dies.' 
As when the eagle swoops down upon a bevy of 
unsuspecting hares, that run blindly about in 
helpless terror until one of their number is 
snatched away, they for a moment stand para- 
lyzed with fear, and then calmly return to nib- 
bling grass as if nothing had occurred. Some 
sought diversion in amusements and set up for 
themselves in a corner of their inclosure a mimic 
representation of their prison life. Here they 
arrayed themselves in fantastic dress and re- 
hearsed the very sorrows of their sad state, as if 
fearful they should forget them, and represented 
the taking off of their companions, seeming to 
find a pleasure even in viewing another's afflic- 
tions. Others amused themselves by gathering 
sticks and stones and constructing for them- 
selves little booths along the wall of their 
prison, in which they would sit and smile in 
silent superiority over those who did not pos- 
sess them, though often they could inhabit 



292 EARTH REVISITED. 

them but an hour. Others went so far as to 
toil with might and main to roll together huge 
stones and build themselves dwellings which 
should endure a century, while they knew they 
could not occupy them more than a few days 
at most. These were regarded by many as the 
most foolish of all, but others seemed to Ben 
Adhem to be even more demented, for they 
would work night and day to scrape together 
the dust of their inclosure in little heaps, over 
which they would stand guard with infinite 
anxiety, and toil until a sudden gust of wind 
would scatter it over the grounds, or they them- 
selves Avould be taken away in the midst of 
their gathering and guarding. Others, follow- 
ing their instincts, like beavers building dams 
in dry places, Avould delve in the mud and 
water of their inclosure to construct bridges 
and roads over which they would convey 
stones, sticks and other debris, only to collect 
it in one place, and then remove it to another. 
This seemed a harmless amusement, until in 
their eagerness to enlarge these idle construc- 
tions they began to compel their fellow-pris- 
oners to labor for them ; snatching from the 
hands of their weaker companions the bread 
supplied to them, they thus compelled them to 
labor unceasingly to regain the pittance granted 
to all by the governor, for their sustenance, 
until they should be called forth. But in the 
midst of the building and toiling, both master 



EARTFI REVISITED, 293 

and slave were summoned to drop their work, 
and thus one found sudden termination to his 
ambition and the other release from his bond- 
age together. 

" But this attempt upon the part of some to 
secure more than their rightful share of the 
provisions allotted them, and to compel their 
fellows to assist them in their useless occupations, 
resulted in endless strife, confusion and cruelty, 
culminating in mutual slaughter and war. 
Thus were their miseries increased tenfold by 
their own acts. 

^^ Others went so far as to pretend to be 
sovereigns themselves, and climbing upon blocks 
of wood, with ragged robes cast about them 
and a stick in their hands, they aped the man- 
ner in which they imagined their ruler lorded 
it over his domain ; while others in imitation 
and hope of similar distinction, bowed before 
their false kings and in turn set themselves 
upon stools around him and endeavored to rule 
over those below them, who in turn imitated 
those above them and despised those beneath 
them, down to the lowest in the scale of 
imaginary distinctions. But the governor 
knew no difference and all alike were sum- 
marily called to their death, and deposited 
in openings in the ground of the same di- 
mensions. 

"Some of these buckram kings would induce 
their subjects to go to war with their riva] . 



294 EARTn BE VISITED. 

and thus by mutual slaughter, antedate the day 
of their death. 

" Many of the women amused themselves by 
picking up shining stones and cast-off feathers 
of birds, and tricking themselves out in these 
toys, paraded before their fellows in such pride 
and vanity, as brought a smile even to the most 
miserable among them. Generally, the older 
and uglier they were and the shorter their stay, 
the more they prided themselves upon their 
vain possessions, and clung to them as if they 
expected to carry them with them when called 
out to execution. But all were stripped of 
their jewels, and their hard-earned acquisitions 
were scattered among those remaining, who in 
turn repeated the folly of their predecessors. 
Some, less vain and envious, gathered their chil- 
dren about them and sought solace in their 
society. But usually, instead of informing 
them of the end awaiting them and instructing 
them to make the best use of the time interven- 
ing, they endeavored to delight their senses in 
delicate indulgence, teaching them to gain all 
they could of the baubles about them and to 
array themselves in vain attire, in imitation of 
the follies of their parents. They also taught 
them to build for themselves booths and dwell- 
ings, as if they expected to remain forever in 
their inclosure, and to seek idle amusement, 
unmindful of the sorrows about them or of the 
wrongs inflicted upon their fellows. 



EARTH REVISITED, 29£ 

" Many sought to disguise their situation by 
the hope of pardon and by speculations as to 
their state after removal. They knew that they 
could not hope for remission of their sentence, 
for not one had ever escaped the decree. But 
they endeavored to mitigate their misery in im- 
aginations of a happier state which might be 
theirs after the death-penalty had been inflicted. 
True, no one had ever returned to inform them 
as to what awaited them after their departure. 
But in their dissatisfaction with their condition 
and hope of a better state, they constructed an 
elaborate ideal of such an existence as they de- 
sired and trusted to attain, though no intima- 
tion of such an existei^pe had been received 
from their sovereign. But having persuaded 
themselves of its reality, they assumed that it 
belonged to them and to such as they might 
admit to its possession. They then proceeded 
to set up for themselves little shrines, around 
which they gathered in sacred seclusion and by 
performing certain ceremonies, imagined that 
thereby they were purchasing admission into 
the invisible estate. Those willing to conform 
to their customs, were admitted to their com- 
panionship, while those unwilling to do so were 
forbidden all participation in their friendship, 
as well as in their imaginary kingdom. Those 
thus excluded thereupon set up shrines and in- 
stituted performances of their own, which im- 
mediately resulted in rivalries, disputes and

endless wordy warfare as to the true touchstone 
for obtaining the fabled future. Some, not 
content with denying their fellows participation 
in their coming blessedness, invented another 
place as much more horrible than their present 
condition, as they could imagine, and care- 
lessly consigned them to its engulfing flames. 
Others, more compassionate, proclaimed that 
all might share in the imaginary estate, who 
would assent to a series of statements formu- 
lated by themselves. ' If you believe there is 
such an existence,' they said, ' you can share in 
its privileges. If you will not believe in it and 
accept our theories regarding it and the man- 
ner of obtaining it, you will be shut out there- 
from. We admit that no one has seen it. No 
one knows whether it exists or not. It all de- 
pends upon what you believe about it. No 
two of us believe alike, yet all depends upon a 
sound belief.' 

" Though numberless petitions had been sent 
to the governor for information regarding the 
future state, no answer had been received. It 
is true that at various times he had sent mes- 
sengers to the prisoners, saying ' Trust me. 
Be kind to each other. Cease disputing about 
my government. Stop striving with each other 
and making yourselves miserable. Comfort 
the sorrowing, aid the unfortunate, sympathize 
with the suffering, cheer the desponding, and

you will find your prison a palace and its penal- 
ties designed for your good.' 

" At one time he even sent a messenger to 
remain among them, and in his own life and 
character, teach them how they ought to live 
and fulfill their sovereign's will. But instead 
of listening to him and following his example, 
some whose customs and characters he con- 
demned, moved with envy, turned upon him 
and slew him, before the time appointed for his 
recall. However a few won by his loving ex- 
ample, believed in him and endeavored to prac- 
tice his precepts. But the majority of their 
companions derided and persecuted them, and 
went on gathering dust, rolling stones, oppress- 
ing their brethren, strutting about in borrowed 
baubles, and disputing about the invisible world 
outside, until they were summoned to enter it. 

" Ben Adhem was greatly grieved at what he 
beheld. The only bright spots in the wretched 
scenes about him were the little children play- 
ing with shouts of innocent glee and singing 
in tones of love and gentleness, and the young 
men and maidens wandering arm-in-arm amid 
the throngs, with looks of love and words of 
tenderness, unconscious of the misery and 
wrong about them and undisturbed by the 
thought of the future. 

" Aroused by these sights and the words of 
the wise messenger, Ben Adhem began to lay 
aside his apprehensions regarding his own fate, 



298 EARTH REVISITED. 

believing that the evidences of wisdom and 
goodness in his sovereign were sufficient to war- 
rant his confidence and trust, and he resolved 
to devote his days to mitigating the miseries of 
his fellows. He soon perceived that these were 
almost entirely caused by themselves ; that the 
prison was really a pleasant place, if one made 
the best of it, and that the example of mutual 
love and trust set by youth and innocence, dis- 
pelled all fear of the future, and allayed the 
evils of their present. 

" He thereupon set to work with all his energy 
to assist the weak, raise the fallen, cheer the 
despondent, and to awaken in his companions a 
sense of their duty to each other, and to unite 
them for mutual aid and sympathy. In so do- 
ing, they found that they not only made their 
companions happy, but they forgot their own 
fate in their efforts for others, and came to re- 
gard their prison with pleasure and their sov- 
ereign with love and confidence. 

" Thus Ben Adhem became one of the happi- 
est of the company, and when his summons 
came, it found him in the midst of his work of 
love and benefaction. He heard it undismayed, 
dropped his implements, laid aside his toil-worn 
garments, washed his hands, and went calmly 
forth to meet his lord, as if invited to a royal 
feast."

" That is certainly a suggestive story, Helen. 
I should be pleased to read more o£ the ^ old 
volume ' in which you discovered it/' I remarked, 
with an incredulous glance, while she blushed 
with pride and pleasure, and her father added : 

" The idea that man is under sentence of ban- 
ishment and death on account of original sin 
has paralyzed his better nature, while his crude 
conceptions of a future life have perverted his 
whole thinking and being. The old theology 
was almost wholly concerned with the personal 
salvation of the individual and his happiness in 
the world to come. The Christianity of creeds 
and churches is outgrown. It was the consum- 
mate flower of loveliness springing out of the 
dry stock of Judaism. But now the flower has 
fallen away and brought forth the full fruit 
of the Religion of Humanity — the Christianity 
of Christ. The doctrine that a mere act of 
faith could change the character or destiny of 



800 EARTH REVISITED, 

the dying, has dekided more mortals than all 
the devices of the devil. It has prevented 
the adoption of true religion by both the igno- 
rant and the thinking. The former hoped to 
obtain the rewards of virtue after living a 
life of vice, by confession and repentance; 
while the latter could but perceive the utter 
futility of faith to change character, and the 
folly of hoping to reap that which they had 
not sown. ^ There is no salvation from sin 
except in a pure life.' " 

" Is not a system of religion necessary ? " I 
interrupted ; to which he replied : 

" An eloquent preacher of the last century 
said pathetically, concerning the religious agita- 
tion of the time, ' Whatever be the outcome, 
whether Christ be accepted as God, or as only 
a prophet of God, the world will still continue 
to be religious.' Indeed the world is religious, 
and far more truly so, now that it has a con- 
sistent, working scheme of theology, applicable 
to all the conditions and activities of life, than 
when it endeavored to hang its practical moral- 
ity upon a theory of God which no man could 
comprehend, and accepted a doctrine of Chris- 
tianity which men confessed in church on Sun- 
days, but found themselves utterly unable to 
apply in their daily lives. We believe in the 
' Man, Christ Jesus,' not in ' the mediaeval 
notion of the mysterious combination of God 
and man.' Each holds such belief regarding 



EARTH REVISITED. 301 

the Christian mysteries of the incarnation, 
resurrection, and ascension as seems most reason- 
able to him. But we would no more think of 
disputing about them or of doubting a fellow- 
man's sincerity and Christian character, on 
account of his belief or disbelief in them, than 
we would on account of his theory of light or 
of the origin of being." 

" What then is the basis of your religion ? " I 
could but ask. 

^' Christianity is a religion of the real," he re- 
pUed. " It is not an ideal drama enacted upon 
an imaginary scene. It was introduced amid 
such a ferment of thought and life as the world 
has never seen. It was born at Jerusalem, the 
focus of the three great civilizations of the 
ancient world, under the shadow of Caesar's 
standards, in the market-place of Greek com- 
merce and culture. Yet in it was nothing of 
the mysticism of the Greek, the fanaticism of 
the Jew or materialism of the Roman. It is 
for man, as man, in his business and his home, 
in society and in solitude, in joy and in sorrow, 
here on the earth in every human relation. 
Our church is a federation of the Protestant 
and Catholic, Jew and unbeliever, in a union 
for the relief of our fellow-men from the evils 
of pauperism, intemperance, ignorance and im- 
morality. Abraham and Job and our own 
Aryan ancestors walked and talked with God 
hand in hand. Prayer is the natural, scientific 



302 EARTH REVISITED, 

recognition of His pervasive, presence. This is 
nothing else than the Christiari"faith arriv^ at 
and confirmed through science aiid-pt8(Ssophy, 
that God is love. This is the Ultimate 
Gospel." 

As my friend paused, I sat silent revolving 
these ideas in my mind, while Helen's sweet 
presence seemed to make them real and vital. 
In the presence of love and virtue, I could but 
feel their power and beauty. I began to see 
the light. 

These truths seemed to be as old and immu- 
table as the earth. As Sophocles sang, they 
were " The unwritten laws of God, which are 
not of to-day nor yesterday." 

But thus far I had beheld and considered the 
life and duties of man dissociated from the 
thought of a future state, either of pain or 
pleasure. Nothing had been taken for granted. 
I had been shown the ground upon which all 
men could stand without assumption of any 
fact beyond the ken and reason of the most 
skeptical. In this new existence no appeal was 
made to man's faith, to his belief in the super- 
natural or to any inspired oracle. I saw that 
there were ample grounds outside of all these 
upon which all men might unite, for the pro- 
motion of their individual and common good, 
and that there were in the knowledge and 
experience of humanity abundant indications 
of the right way and inspirations to pursue it, 



EARTH HEVISlTEl). 303 

which would assure man's highest welfare here 
and happiness hereafter. I had seen that the 
movement of society and industry had de- 
monstrated that selfishness is impracticable, and 
that in co-operation and universal brotherhood, 
man fulfills his destiny on the earth and the 
designs of his Creator. Yet all this truth had 
come in upon me like a flood, and my old faith 
was flying about like Noah's dove, finding no 
place for the soles of its feet. 

" Are these what you call the facts of relig- 
ion ? " I at length asked, eagerly. " These 
are what I want, what I have been groping 
for all my life, what I sighed for on my dying 
bed." 

" My dear boy, certain universal facts you 
have apprehended," replied my father, fondly. 
" Life is ours to use and enjoy ; fraternity and 
mutual helpfulness fulfill its end. The divinity / 
of conscience, the supremacy of love, the uni- ' 
versality of moral law, the unity of man and 
naturej these are facts. What lies beyond the / 
grave, we do not know; Hut hope paints the 
evening sky in radiant hues, and the conscious- 
ness of a life well spent closes the eyes in 
peace. If there be no God and no hereafter, 
it is better to live justly, to walk humbly, love 
thy neighbor and die in hope. If there be a 
hereafter, you have then made the best possi- 
ble preparation for it. ' Nature is the voice of . 
Godj. wooing man to paths of peace and pleas- 



304 EARTH 11 EV IS IT ED, 

aiitiiess.' The tragic story of human history 
teaches that selfishness and sin defeat their 
own ends ; unrighteousness^ works its own rec- 
ompense. These are facts which require no 
faith for their appreheriision." 

" But is not rehgious w^orship an act of 
faith ? " I interposed. 

" Man is a rehgious animal," he replied, 
" and to worship is natural. The savage bowed 
in fear before the powers of nature, which he 
did not understand. The Persian worshiped 
God in the all-giving, glorious sun. The Egyp- 
tian adored the power of life in all living 
things. The Greek made his gods in his own 
image, deifying his own powers and passions, 
installing them upon Olympus, but little raised 
above the level of his daily life. The Hebrew 
worshiped the infinite might and majesty of 
moral law — the one God in all and through all. 
The Christian adores the same God, ' whom all 
ignorantly worshiped,' beholding his ' express 
image ' in the face of Jesus Christ. ' This is 
the light that enlighteneth every man that 
Cometh into the world ; ' ' for we all are his 
oflfspring,' as sang the Greek poet, quoted by 
Paul at Athens. We worship God in service to 
man. Those so disposed, meet together for 
prayer and praise, but they do not thereby con- 
sider themselves better than those who serve 
God only in deeds.'" 

" But are there not those who do not believe 



EAHTll REV IS LT ED. 305 

in God?" I inquired further. To which he 
made answer. 

" The existence of God is not a theorem to 
be demonstrated. It is a problem that is 
solved. If there were no God, as Voltaire 
says, ^it would be necessary to invent Him.' 
Archbishop Tillotson said before him, ' If God 
were not a necessary being, He might almost 
seem to be made for the use and benefit of 
man.' So we lay down our postulate : ' Let 
there be a God.' From this we draw the di- 
rect conclusion : if there be a God, He is good, 
and all men are His children. Hence all are 
brothers, and He is best served by showing our 
love unto our brethren. We all claim the friend- 
ship of God by right of relationship. We are 
born into His family, not adopted. We do not 
need an introduction to our father. The poor 
Indian who ^sees God in the cloud and hears 
Him in the wind,' is much nearer to Him than 
the materialist, or the believer whose theology 
removes his Creator far away to a throne of 
idolatrous awe. Recognizing the actual pres- 
ence of God compels one to live in holiness." 

" But does not modern science reject the idea 
of God?" I again asked, recalling the asser- 
tions of certain so-called scientists in my time. 

" On the contrary," replied my friend, "there 

is no science without it. One of the pro- 

foundest plKlosophers and ablest writers of the 

nineteenth century. Prof. John Fiske, says : 
20 



306 EARTH BEVISITED. 

' The presence of God is the one all-pervading 
fact of life from which there is no escape. 
For the great mass of men the idea of God is 
quite overlaid and obscured by innumerable 
symbolic rites and doctrines that have grown 
up in the course of the long historic develop- 
ment of religion. Such concrete symbols have 
in all ages been argued and fought for until 
they have come to seem the essentials of religion. 
Every pulsation of the universe is none other 
than the living God. We see man still the 
crown and glory of the universe and the chief 
object of divine care, yet still the lame and 
halting creature, loaded with a brute inheritance 
of original sin, whose ultimate salvation is 
slowly to be achieved through ages of moral 
discipline. And in all this we find the strong- 
est imaginable incentive to right living.' " 

"Do you believe in the devil?" I inter- 
rupted, recalling the creeds of my contempo- 
raries on that subject. 

" There are not two Gods," he answered 
patiently. " Our faith can find and our 
reason recognize but one. The universe is not 
a divided kingdom. ' God has not given power 
to resist his beneficent purposes into other 
hands.' The idea of a spirit of evil at war with 
God is abhorrent to both reason and religion. 
The modern idea of the devil seems to have 
been largely derived from Milton's Satan, the 
hero of his immortal poem. That does not 



EARTU REVISITED. 307 

explain the origin of evil. The idea of a per- 
sonal devil seems to have originated in man's 
innate propensity to shift his responsibility for 
wrong-doing upon others. As Adam in his 
transgression sought to lay his fault upon his 
fair partner and she in turn upon the serpent, 
so men in all ages have sought to excuse their 
inward dispositions, by the fiction of an out- 
ward tempter. Let us be honest and admit 
our own responsibility for our acts. It is 
absurd to speak of sin as something external 
to us. ' Sin is man setting himself against 
the law of his own nature.' No believer in 
God can believe in the devil. To assume both 
is to affirm a contradiction." 

" We can wiUingly dispense with the devil," 
I remarked. 

" The loving father will not allow any of his 
children to be lost," he answered. " He leav- 
eth the ninety-and-nine and goeth after the lost 
one, witil he find it. There is no ' plan of 
salvation' presented in the Gospel, but the 
Divine love, illustrated in a perfect human life. 
The only salvation is freedom from sin. There 
is no need of an atonement to reconcile God to 
man. He is not an angry Deity inflicting 
punishment upon a sinless substitute in order 
to satisfy the demands of ' Divine Justice.' 

" The very term justice, is a misnomer ap- 
plied to God. It can only arise from the, 
* human conception of injustic'C as an injury. 



308 EARTH BE VISITED, 

Man cannot injure God. ^ He does not enter 
into Judgnienit with His creatures.' He ever 
stands between man and his misdoing. The idea 
of Christ as a mediator, standing between man 
and an offended God, is a total misconception 
of the character of both. How far below that 
of an affectionate father to whom his children 
come with the ' perfect love which casteth out 
fear ' and speak face to face ! " 

" Have you at last found the desire of the 
ages ? " I could but ask ; " the common ground 
and basis of a religion acceptable to all classes 
and conditions of men ? " 

« 

" Love and service to God and man/' he 
responded, •" furnish the common denomi- 
nator." 

" In addition, the scientific developments of 
the nineteenth century and the establishment 
of the doctrine of evolution, so far from under- 
mining the idea of God and the hope of im- 
mortahty, have established them upon an im- 
pregnable basis. The orderly sequence of the 
course of nature through evolution up to the 
mind and moral nature of man, can only be 
explained by the existence of a mind and 
moral nature, which is the force imminent 
in all the movements and life of the uni- 
verse. The scientific basis of Theism is 
recognized practically by all scientific men. 
y ' The universe in all its parts is the visible 
manifestation to us of underlying mind.' These 



EARTH REVIlSlTEl). 309 

truths, dimly apprehended by the leading think- 
ers of the past century, are now the recognized 
and generally accepted facts at the base of our 
religious life. Our religion is not so much a 
matter of faith in a written revelation, as of 
demonstration from the truths of science and 
human history. As in the earliest ages, men 
met God face to face in nature with child-like 
confidence, and at a later period lost sight of 
Him in the fogs of their own follies and vain 
imaginings, only recalled by the voices of His 
prophets ringing through the darkness, so now 
we see Him again in all his works and hear His 
words in the still, small voice within." 

" But is not the Bible the infallible rule of 
faith and practice? " I interposed again. 

"It is to those who make it such," he 
replied, but ' not all God's word is scripture.' 
Ours is not the religion of a book. The teach- 
ing of the seers and saints of all ages have 
kept alive in the earth the knowledge of the 
living God. Now, we have a ' more sure 
word ' in the interpretation of his creation and 
understanding of the moral constitution of 
society. The theologians of the past, laying 
down the nature and designs of God a priori^ 
proceeded to deduce therefrom the nature, duty 
and destiny of man. We pursue the opposite 
course. Beginning with what is universally 
accepted as to the character, condition and 
nature of man and of the world which he in- 



310 EARTH REVISITED. 

habits, we learn therefrom the character and 
f 'r ? will of God. Our ideas of God and moral 
obligation are not derived from theological 
theories, or based upon the will of an absolute 
ruler ; but our theology is evolved from the 
ethical nature of man. Our knowledge of the 
beneficence and love of God and of His designs 
for human happiness are derived from what 
experience teaches to be the only means of per- 
fecting human character. The mystery of 
sorrow and suffering, pain and misery, under 
the omnipotent rule of an all-wise God, is a mys- 
tery no longer. ' We must learn by pleasure 
to pursue the right, by suffering to avoid the 
wrong.' " 

" I begin to see the light," I exclaimed. "I 
can but shudder as I recall the mental dark- 
ness, as well as the moral degradation, in which 
I lived in the past. I thank God that I have 
been permitted to see this day and walk in its 
light. It only remains for me to find my place 
and begin my work in the world, if perchance, 
I may undo some of the evil that I have done." 

" There you meet the most stupendous prob- 
lem of life," exclaimed my friend ; '' the prob- 
lem which attends us from the cradle to the 
grave, confronts us in the heaven above and 
the earth beneath. Evil cannot be undone. 
^ Not God Himself upon the past has power.' 
^ The evil that men do lives after them.' Repent- 
ance cannot restore innnocence. Penitence 



EARTH REVISITED. 311 

cannot prevail, nor punishment purify. Your 
friend can forgive your injury or insult to him- 
self, but who can restore to your soul its pris- 
tine purity and peace? God has nothing to 
forgive. He is ever pitiful to His children; 
but he cannot restrain their hands from self- 
defacement, or restore their lost virtue. Op- 
portunity comes once to all and is gone forever. 
Nature has no balm for a broken body, no cure 
for a cankered soul. Man may repent, reform, 
cease to do evil and learn to do good ; but the 
past is his no more — nor God's. By every act 
of impurity or iniquity, the altitude and strength 
of his moral stature is forever dwarfed. Self- 
ishness is suicide." 

" But may there not be reparation and resti- 
tution hereafter ? " I interposed, appalled at 
this view of the case. 

" Never was there a more direful delusion," 
he went on, " than that death can change char- 
acter. We are in eternity now. The laws of 
nature and of God must be the same, here and 
in the stars. All idea of immortality is aban- 
doned, if we are not the same after death as 
before, if consciousness does not continue. 
But the soul cannot change. It is I, myself. 
Its conditions may change ; its environment 
may be vastly different ; but its life can be but 
a continuance of its earthly existence. It must 
go into another world, ' with all its imperfections 
on its head.' There is no remission. There is 



312 EARTU REVISITED, 

neither punishment nor pardon. These were 
the twin pillars of Christian theology." 

" What then/' I could but exclaim, " be- 
comes of the common idea of heaven and hell ? " 

" It is all an idle illusion, inconsistent with 
every truth of nature and of experience," he 
replied. " If there be such a heaven as men 
dream of, the only possible means of gaining 
it is by doing their duty in this world, and if 
they do not become fit for it now, they can- 
not enjoy it hereafter. If the selfish and the 
sensual could sit down with the righteous and 
redeemed, they would be as uncomfortable as 
a sot at a sacrament." 

" I think I apprehend your meaning," I re- 
marked, as he paused. " But through all this 
discussion has appeared a great If — if there 
be a hereafter. Do you not believe in the im- 
mortality of the soul ? " 

" I have made that reservation for two rea- 
sons," he responded. " In the first place, I 
feared the use of the term ^hereafter' might 
be associated in your mind with the ideas of 
heaven and hell prevalent with past genera- 
tions. We connect no such ideas with the 
terms. In the second place, what you or I be- 
lieve as to immortality does not aflfect the fact. 
In deducing man's duty in the world, we do 
not draw upon matters of belief ; and in my 
statements to you, I did not wish to found any 
inference upon my personal opinions. We 



EARTH REVISITED. 313 

seek a basis upon which all men can agree. 
The matter of religion has been presented to 
men wrong end first. The inducements and 
encouragements for leading a righteous life 
have been drawn from the rewards and punish- 
ments of a life hereafter, instead of deducing 
the life to come from the life that now is. The 
only absolutely and universally acknowledged 
facts — those of this life — were disregarded for 
matters of faith and inference. It was an 
attempt to demonstrate an axiom by a hypoth- 
esis. Now, I may say that the greatest achieve- 
ment of this century is that we have overcome 
the fear of death. Socrates, whose death is 
the most noble recorded of men, said, ^ I would 
search over Europe and Asia to discover the 
man who has found a charm to destroy the fear 
of death.' The Christian martyrs overcame 
it in the exaltation of their faith in an immedi- 
ate paradise of glory. But such enthusiasm is 
not given to those who have not had their 
experience. We can no more feel their faith 
than die their death. But the future has for 
us no fear. The king of terrors is no more. 
Only the selfish materialist fears the grave. As 
Robert Browning says, ^ Without death, which 
is our crape-like, churchyardy word for change, 
for growth, there could be no prolongation of 
that which we call life.' Our only regret is at 
leaving life. There is here so much to inter- 
est a man of thought and observation, so much 



314 EAR Til REVISITED. 

to arouse his finer feelings to action, so much 
good to be done, so much evil to be overcome, 
so many grand achievements of science, art 
and humanity to be perceived and participated 
in, that one feels almost stunned by the brevity 
of life. Yet, when we consider that each year 
now is a century of the past, and that in 
thought and feeling, and all that make life 
worth living, a thousand years are ours, we 
take heart of hope. Again we have so far ad- 
vanced in the cure and prevention of disease, 
and the extension of active life, both in its earlier 
and later years, that we find life much longer 
and more satisfactory. I am ninety years of 
age, though you doubtless took me to be a 
man of sixty. We do not spend our days run- 
ning a race for a bauble and fall to the earth 
out of breath before it is half run. We now 
give as much attention to the rearing and 
training of children as former generations did 
to the breeding of prize cattle and fast horses. 
They are taught from the first the facts of the 
continuity of life and to regard death, not with 
horror, but as a step upward, a graduation. 

" Yet, death comes at last. But so gently 
does he disrobe us, and so insidiously unloose 
our bands of life, that we unconsciously fall 
asleep as one wearied with the toil of a day well 
spent. ' Life without death would be a fixed 
high noon of intolerable heat, a monotonous 
plain of existence, a day with no rosy dawn or 



EARTU REVISITED. 315 

sunset glow, a year with no budding spring or 
golden autumn. But for death and sorrow, man 
would be given up to utter worldliness.' We 
do not regard death as an end, but a reversion, 
a return, the rounding of a cycle of life. The 
Nirvana of Buddha has for us no attraction. 
Without memory, death ends all. Uncon- 
sciousness is annihilation. The soul clings to 
its individuality as to its life. 

" ' We have ever been 
And ever more shall be.' 

Matter cannot cease to be. Much less can 
the soul. ' The immortality of the atom is the 
guaranty of the immortality of the soul.' " 

" But where and how does the soul continue 
its existence ? " Tasked. 

" Certainly not upon some ' unearthly conti- 
nent,' " replied my friend. " It caimot be 
different in kind from that on this globe. 

" Both sajre and saint ajjfree that ' the mem- 
ory of the just is as a shining light which 
shineth more and more unto the perfect day.' 
If ' true fame is the regard of our contem- 
poraries,' to be held in memory of good deeds 
is immortality. We live in our generation, in 
our impress upon the age, in our children, and 
in the succession of generations like the foliage 
of the forests. Nature proclaims upon a thou- 
sand shores the endless renewal of life." 



316 EARTH REVISITED. 

" But have you no more definite notion as- 
to the place in which the life of the soul is 
continued?" I asked, unable to divest my 
mind of the materialistic conceptions of heaven, 
derived from my theological teachings. I had 
heard it described and measured and its capac- 
ity computed, and the ^standing room ' assigned 
to each stated. The literalist had even gone 
so far as to calculate the size of the oysters in 
which grew the pearls for the city gates." 

" We do not speculate as to heaven," re- 
plied my friend. "We demonstrate the ad- 
vantage of taking it for granted, as Pascal did. 
He puts it as a wager. ' If there be a God, a 
heaven, a hereafter, a man has everything to 
gain by living a good life. And even if he 
lose the wager, a man who has lived a life of 
rectitude and goodness has lost nothing.' He 
has made the most of the existence which he 
possessed. The truths and obligations of re- 
ligion are of universal application. They are 
eternal as nature, and as broad as the needs of 
humanity. However, heaven does not hang 
in the air. The Bible gives intimations in 
regard to it. The promises to the faithful 
Israelite were long life, children, and abundance 
in basket and in store. They hoped for a 
return to the world in which they lived. Man 
must enter the next world what he is in this. 
Death can make no change ; nor repentance, 
nor faith. Not what you beUeve, or hope or

imagine can aflfect the future life. You, and 
no other, are the man who must live hereafter." 

" But where shall I live ? " I could but ask 
again. 

" The millennium is here now and always, if 
we all want it. We are building here the 
temple of the hereafter. Science establishes it ; 
Religion invests it with its divine illumination. 
Love and Hope and Joy dwell therein. It 
stands firm based on earth, but ' eternal sun- 
shine settles round its head.' ^Man claims 
immortality by the divine heritage of hope.' 
' Everywhere in nature we find death to be the 
first step to further progress, the invariable 
antecedent of higher life, the prelude to en- 
trance, to another state. The purpose of such 
a world is plain to read. It means that not 
happiness here is the end for which we are to 
strive. For such a personality as man, there 
must be a future. Such a personality belongs 
to the meaning of the universe.' The sons of 
God are not born to die." 

As my friend paused, a cloud seemed to lift 
from my mind, and beneath it shot forth the 
beams of the broad sun of truth, flooding the 
earth with the hues of hope. I was dazzled 
for a moment by its splendor. I arose and 
grasped his hand in ecstasy. The prejudices 
of the past were o^one. I was no longer the 
slave of superstition. The truth had made me 
free. 



318 EARTH REVISITED. \ , 

" I see it all now," I exclaimed. " Lead me 
to my work. Let me aid in the regeneration 
of the world." 

As I said this, a new light shone in his eye. 
He gazed upon me with awe and exultation. 

" You ! You ! " he declared, as he pressed 
my hand, " You are the evidence. You have 
consciously returned to earth. You are a 
living demonstration of the continued life of 
man ! " 
I Helen placed her arm about me and in 
sweet tones whispered : " This is heaven ; 
this is immortality. To live is to love and to 
j labor. There is no death."

The New Time : a Plea for the Union of 
the floral Forces for Practical Progress. 

This new work, by the author of ** Civilization's In- 
ferno," deals with practical methods for the reform of 
specific social evils. The writer does not bind together a 
mere bundle of social speculations, that would seem to 
many to have only a remote and abstract relevance to 
everyday life. He deals with facts within every one's 
knowledge. ** The New Time " brings its matter di- 
rectly home to every man's bosom and business — follow- 
ing Bacon's prescription. 

It is published especially to meet the wants of those 
who wish to apply themselves to and interest their friends 
in the various branches of educational and social effort 
comprised in the platform of the National Union for Prac- 
tical Progress ; but, from its wide sweep of all the factors 
in the social problem, it will also serve to introduce many 
readers to a general consideration of the newer social 
thinking.

Five lectures dealing with Christianity and evolutionary

Mr. Savage stands in the van of the progress of moral, 
humane and rational ideas of human society and religion, 
which must be inextricably commingled in the new think- 
ing, and a stronger word for moral and intellectual free- 
dom has never been written than ** The Irrepressible 

Conflict." We are now going through the greatest revo- 
lution of thought the world has ever seen. It means 
nothing less than a new universe, a new God, a new man, 
a new destiny.

JUST PLAIN FOLKS. 

A novel for the industrial millions, illustrating two stu-

##1. The bounty and goodness of nature. 

##2. The misery resulting from unjust social conditions 
which enable the acquirer of wealth to degenerate in 
luxury and idleness, and the wealth producer to slave him- 
self to death, haunted by an ever-present fear of starva- 
tion when not actually driven to vice or begging. It is an 
exceedingly interesting book, simply and afFectingly told, 
while there is a vast deal of the philosophy of commun- 
ism in the moralizing of Old Bat. All persons interested in 
wholesome fiction, and who also desire to understand the 
conditions of honest industry and society-made vice, 
should read this admirable story.

AI : A Social Vision. 

One of the most ingenious, unique and thought-provoking 
stories of the present generation. It is a social vision, and in 
many respects the most noteworthy of the many remarkable 
dreams called forth by ihe general unrest ami intellectual activ- 
ity of the present generation. But unlike m&lt; st social dreams 
appearing since the famous *• Utopia " of Sir Thomas More, 
this book has distinctive qualities which wiU commend it to 
many readers who take, as yet, little interest in the \ital social 
problems of the hour. A quiet humor perva :es the whole vol- 
ume which is most delightful. 

The brotherhood of man and varitjus sociological and philan- 
thropic ideas, such as the es^alilishment &lt; f a college settlement 
and the social regencratii)ii oi Old Phiiudelphia, are a few of 
the topics discussed in *• Ai," a novel by Charles Daniel, who 
calls it " A Social Vision." It is alternately giave and gay; and 
the intellectual freshness reminds one constantly of Edward 
Everett Hale's stories, with which " Ai " has much in common. 
This is a clever book, and, what is much more important, one 
whose influence is for good. — Public Ledger,

Elbert | poRBES OF HARVARD. 
Hubbard 

In "Forbes of Harvard" Mr. Elbert Hubbard has pro- 

" duced a work which has won the unqualified praise of all 
lovers of clean, wholesome and elevated fiction. Below 
v/e give some critical opinions of this most delightful 

' work. 

Syracuse Herald " &lt; Forbes of Harvard.* A delicate atid artistic piece of work, 

full of high-toned sentiment, good-natured and finely shaded 
character drawing." 

" The book has a flavor of Concord, and the influence of 
Emerson, the Alcotts and Thoreau is felt throughout it. It is 
philosophical, moral, religious and social in its bearings, but no 
one of these matters is given undue precedence." 

** The author of * Forbes of Harvard ' has succeeded in doing 
what very few writers have done. He has told a bright, clever 
story by means of a series of letters. Instead of describing his 
characters he has let them reveal themselves in their epistles." 

" * Forbes of Harvard * is a series of letters written by differ- 
ent persons, one of whom is at Harvard, and tells in an inter- 
estingly vivid way a neat and good story, sure to be read with 
pleasure."

THE FORTUNES OF flARQARET WELD. 

A novel dealing with the relation of the sexes in a bold 
but delicate manner. 

This book tells the story of a good woman who made a 
grave mistake. It touches our hearts like an old sorrow, 
and we go with Margaret on her tortuous earth journey ; 
we partake of her ambitions and her joys; we know the 
bitterness of her portion, and we, too, catch glimpses and 
feel somewhat at the last of her serene peace. A lofty 
purpose runs throughout the pages. A just tribute is in- 
directly paid to the Quakers, the only sect who having 
power never persecuted ; the people who made the only 
treaty that was never sworn to-and yet never broken. The 
world will be better for this book.

AN ^UNOFFICIAL PATRIOT. 

Have you read Helen H. Gardener's new war story, **An 
Unofficial Patriot"? No? Then read what competent 
critics say of this remarkable historical story of tha Civil 
War. 

" Helen H. Gardener has made for herself within a very few 
years an enviable fame for the strength and sincerity of her 
writing on some of the most important phases of modern social 
questions. Her most recent novel, now published under the title 
of** An Unofficial Patriot,' is no less deserving of praise. As an 
artistic piece of character study this book is possessed of supe- 
rior qualities. There is nothing in it to offend the traditions of 
an honest man, north or south. It is written with an evident 
knowledge of the circumstances and surroundings such as niight 
have made the story a very fact, and, more than all, it is writttB*# 
with an assured sympathy for humanity and a recognitioi of 
right and wrong wherever found. As to the literary merifc of 
the book and its strength as a character study, as has been %id 
heretofore, it is a superior work. The study of Griffith Da^ 
port, the clergyman, and of his true friend, * Lengthy * Pattei 
is one to win favor from every reader. There are dramaMc 
scenes in their association that thrill and touch the hes#t. 
Davenport's two visits to President Lincoln are other scenes 
worthy of note for the same quality, and they show an apprecia- 
tion of the feeling and mutive of the president more than histod- 
cal in its sympathy. Mrs. Gardener may well be proud of h« 
success in the field of fiction." * ' 

" Helen Gardener's new novel, * An Unofficial Patriot,* whicj 
is just out, will probably be the most popular and salable novfll 
since * Robert Elsmere.' It is by far the most finished an&amp; 
ambitious book yet produced by the gifted, author and well d^ 
serves a permanent place in literature. . \ 

" The plot of the story itself guarantees the present sale. It 
is * something new under the sun ' and strikes new sensation8,ik 
new situations, new conditions. To be sure it is a war story, and 
war stories are old, and hackneyed. But there has been no such 
war story as this written. It gives a situation new in fiction and 
tells the story of the war from a standpoint which gives the book 
priceless value as a sociological study and as supplemental 
history. 

" The plot is very strong and is all the more so when the 
reader learns that it is true. The story is an absolutely true one 
and is almost entirely a piece of history written in form of fie 
tion, with names and minor incidents altered."
